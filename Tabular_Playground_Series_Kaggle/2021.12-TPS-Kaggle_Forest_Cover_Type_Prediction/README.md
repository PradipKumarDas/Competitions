# Tabular Playground Series - Dec. 2021

### *Predicting forest cover type from cartographic variables.*

**https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-dec-2021/**

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on multi-class classification accuracy.

**Submision File**
For each `Id` in the test set, you must predict `Cover_Type` class. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

|	Id		|	Cover_Type	|
|	-----	|	----------	|
|	4000000	|		2		|
|	4000001	|		1		|
|	4000002	|		3		|
|	...		|		...		|

## Data
For this competition, a categorical target based on a number of feature columns given in the data is predicted. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a the data from the [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/overview "Forest Cover Type Prediction").

**Files**
- `train.csv` - the training data with the target `Cover_Type` column
- `test.csv` - the test set; the `Cover_Type` (the target integer class) for each row in this file is predicted
- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format
