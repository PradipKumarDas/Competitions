# Tabular Playground Series - Nov. 2021

### *Predicting identifying spam emails via various extracted features from the email.*

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

**Submision File**
For each `id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the `target` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

|	id		|	target	|
|	---		|	------	|
|	600000	|	0.5		|
|	600001	|	0.5		|
|	600002	|	0.5		|
|	...		|	...		|

## Data
For this competition, a binary `target` based on 100 feature columns given in the data are predicted. All columns are continuous.

The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a real-world dataset used to identify spam emails via various extracted features from the email.

**Files**
- `train.csv` - the training data with the `target` column
- `test.csv` - the test set; you will be predicting the `target` for each row in this file (the probability of the binary target)
- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format

## Solution Approaches
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Modeling with Evaluation
	- Modeling with Tree-based Models
	- Modeling with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
