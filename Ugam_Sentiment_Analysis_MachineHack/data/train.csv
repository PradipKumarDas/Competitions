This one started with adding a whole house water filter to our house. I have done some basic plumbing over the years but new to PEX, my cutter was a bit old so a new one was in order. The Kobalt PEX cutter was ideal and able to cut through the pipe in a single squeeze with a clean crisp cut. My older cutter did not have replaceable blade but this Kobalt cutter does so the blade can be replaced easily. I finished installing the water filter with no problems.

551,"The M-pact nozzle is an interesting concept that works decently.Construction of the nozzle is solid with no leaks coming from either the connection point to the hose or anywhere else on the nozzle itself. The head of the nozzle is rotatable, allowing for horizontal or vertical coverage. Essentially what the M-Pact nozzle does is pulsate the water stream and flicks it side to side (think of holding a regular hose nozzle and using your wrists to move it side to side).If you don't own a pressure washer or don't want to invest that kind of money, this is a good alternative to dislodge stuck on grime with minimal effort.As the packaging states, it is not for use on plants. I gave it a try on a weed that was growing in our garden. It will snap your plants and send dirty splattering due to the force of the impact. Overall it's an interesting tool to help get some dirt, grime or other substrates dislodged and removed, however the pulsating and unsteady stream makes it difficult to get a good clean. My recommendation would be to start off with the M-pact, then switch over to another nozzle that provides a steady steam of water to wash away what's left.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1

Dewalt heavy duty clamps have been OK, Woodriver (Woodcraft brand) are OK, but they tend to pull or push the pieces of wood when tightened because the clamp heads don't come together perfectly square. These don't seem to have as much play so they come together fairly square. Because of this, I can tighten them on a glue-up and not have to realign the wood as much. They have pretty good strength. The triggers on Dewalt clamps sometimes come out or the plastic housing comes apart, but these haven't had any issues yet. One of them sometimes slips so I will see if they'll send a replacement.

975,"3 years and running with daily May - September use. This is the only model that I've ever purchased several of. One for the back, another for the front, more to replace the wands that got stepped on or left out in freezing weather (freeze damage). Bought more for friends and family. This model is the least leaky of any I've tried over 50 years of watering. Easy operate flow control/shut off. Easy to change, very functional pattern settings. Great for Bonsai, potted plants, spot watering, car washing, planter washing etc.It's great for a short reach and for distancing myself from the splatter of rinsing and washing so many things.I wrote this after searching for another to replace the freeze damaged wand. The damage is my fault. It can be prevented by draining or keeping from freezing. I'm going to buy several because I'm undependable at winter storage.  If there is an improvement I can suggest it is to engineer something to prevent the hose from flexing at the attach point - but that would make it more expensive.

I've never had a problem with those. Oh, and for whatever reason it came with a quick connect attachment. What's with that. No receipt in the mail package so can't return it.

I double-checked the toilet myself using online advice and couldn't find anything wrong. I replaced all of the flush hardware in the tank. Nothing worked. I called another plumber. He said the jets below the rim of the bowl were clogged and that I should just put in a new toilet. I was a little skeptical since 11 years didn't seem all that old to me. Also the old toilet never worked all that well, and I wondered whether its relatively low 1.6 GPF was the true culprit. This made me concerned about the even lower GPF of the new toilets. But, being out of options, I went ahead and replaced the old toilet with this one. Bottom line is this new toilet is working perfectly.

In the middle of a nite tinkle!).  For the dual flush one would flush one or the other button but not both -wpuld be awkward. Well when u flush one and your finger goes down with the button there is a gap where ur finger would naturally slide to (button not that big) and gets pinched by the empty gap under the other button.   Yicks this pinched my kid and only then I had recalled when the same happened to me at night.  This is a problem that could easily be fixed by closing each button fully without gaps under them both.  ** Please please fix.. it there is a different buttons that I can purchase and replace I'm all in.

So here goes. First the item viewable description. It is plastic except for springs and stand or stake. It is designed to mount in the ground by the ground stake. I had to figure out how to change the direction or direction change. That is controlled by a set of fingers that are clasped around the base and the sprinkler head rotates as it pulses and is turned a different direction when it contacts one side of the fingers. I had to also figure out that in order to make it pulse for a more wide area, I had to flip out the spring on the pulse head out and move the fingers all the way backward. It will then pulse all the way around and then back again. I haven't found a way to make it pulse only like a quarter way, half way, three quarter way and etc. It's not like some I have owned in the past. It's a nice sprinkle head, just not one that I would purchase for my own use. For that reason alone is why I could only give it four stars.

The trick was to start the screws while the box was lose against the bracket, then tighten the screws to pull the box in.  It was confusing how this was going to work until I figured that out.  Also, the box was not parallel to the ceiling after mounting.  I had to add ~1/4"" of spacers to one side of my fan mounting bracket so that the fan housing would be level.  I don't think the stud that the bracket was screwed into was that far off vertical.

I switched out the plastic wire connector with a metal one that was suitable for two 14-2 since I spliced into a line that conveniently went directly over where I was installing the ceiling fan. Every other ceiling fan I installed was a light fixture replacement with the box attached to a joist. This was the first time that I needed to use a device like this. I was very pleased. I laid the ends flush with the drywall and turned the expander until the prongs dug into the joists. The weight rating noted is for 16"" or 24"" joist spacing but the expander can be used for anything within the two. This is good for me since the builder of my housing development didn't give his workers tape measures. I was going 22"".   Then I fed the wires through and tightened the clamp.

You can turn the nozzle all the way counterclockwise to turn off the flow of water, or turn it clockwise through the different spray settings, until you find the setting you wish to use.5. I love how far in distance this nozzle can spray at its hardest spray setting. I don't have unwind the hose much. Just a few times so a can turn in the direction I wish to spray, and then I can spray about 25 â€“ 30 feet from where I am standing. That makes it very convenient.6. It also has a wide spray setting that I like to use. It sprays about 8 feet wide in circumference, covering large areas at a time, when spraying plants that are a little closer to you.There wasn't anything I didn't like about this nozzle.

Whether I am watering our lawn or plants, if I'm interrupted I sometimes drop the nozzle rather than ""place"" it on the ground. Very happy to see how well made it seems and also looks to be very durable. First of all, it connected easily to our hose, no leaks whatsoever. This is controlled solely by the pistol grip. Squeeze it just a little and it is a wide angle spray, give a bit more pressure and as you go, the more concentrated the spray is. Squeeze it All the way in and you have your Jet spray and it is Very powerful. You can control the spray by using the twisting screw on the nozzle and there is also a lock off metal tab that you can use so you don't have squeeze the handle constantly. A rubber protector on the front protects the nozzle. For watering the lawn or plants, I used it at the wider angles but I must say that it did come in handy also for the vehicles and for anything else we needed it for. I like that I get different spray levels by just squeezing and not having to twist the nozzle. Thank you expert gardener for coming up with a very handy multi use nozzle.

The thumb controlled valve allows you to decrease the flow as you need for more delicate plants or objects.My only problem with this wand is that the fitting at the handle where you thread your hose on is made of plastic.

3319,"I replaced four recessed can fittings in a cathedral-type ceiling with these fan braces. As the can wiring had been butchered in a previous modification to hang pendant lights, a regular can to pendant conversion kit was not an option. Going this route allowed me to do a clean job of the wiring and restore the ground connections. Removing the airtight cans was a major hassle, as they were solidly-made USA-manufactured, rather than a modern imported type. I also found very poor insulation around the cans and usually nothing between the can and the roof sheathing, leading to the cans becoming too hot to touch when the afternoon sun reached the roof.One of the installations required the use of the version of this brace with a slightly larger box because of the number of cables it had to handle. Installation through the old larger can hole was very easy.

3777,"This was a great option for me because I just needed the tool to repair a leak and reroute the piping on a new RV toilet install. Prior to ordering, I took a fieldtrip to Lowe's to price out the tools and I wasn't interested in investing in the cinch tool ($80-$100) and the pipe cutting tool ($25-$30) especially since I probably wasn't going to use it a bunch outside of the initial project.I considered trying to 'cheap out' and use a pair of needle nose pliers to clamp and a miter saw to cut the PEX to size , but I'm really glad I didn't. The clamps were harder to close than I anticipated, but the cinch tool made quick work of them (I don't know that I would've had the leverage required with a pair of regular pliers). The cutting tool was amazing. Very little force was needed to cut and the cuts were super clean!The carrying case is an added plus because I'm keeping it in my RV in case there are any future PEX problems and it keeps everything organized and stores away nicely in an area where I don't have a lot of extra storage.I can't speak to the longevity of the tools, since I will hopefully only need to use them once or twice, but they definitely made the job easier and saved me a lot of time and money from taking it to someone else to do the work.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

3806,"One of my patio door screen had a rip along the side. I was seriously contemplating replacing the door itself. It was one of my buddies who suggested to try this. And I was not disappointedThe kit had all the tools that you need to replace the mesh. A spline tool for removing the existing spline, roller to install new splines, spline roll long enough for 2 doors, a measuring tape and a utility knife and of course more than enough mesh screen.The process literally took 15 minutes. Of that I think I spent longest in removing the existing screen. The old spline was dried up over the years and started crumbling when I started removing them. Installing the new mesh was very easy. Instructions provided were sufficient for DIY. I would recommend to have someone help you towards the end, just to stretch the mesh , so that the screen remains taut.Only issue I had was with the roller, I think I might have pressed the spline in little too hard while rolling, that I damaged the mesh and cut a tiny portion (few mm long) on one corner. Just a heads up - you don't need to exert too much pressure while installing the spline. If you feel that it is popping out in some parts, you can use a blunt but flatter object , like handle of a dining knife or a fork to push it back in.Over all a great purchase.

They were looked at by two professional mesh installers, and neither would take the job without replacing the blinds first. They are almost new and expensive, so no go. This product beautifully solved the issue for a tiny fraction of the cost of a professional installation.I am useless when it comes to DIY, and yet found installing the product relatively easy, and the materials sufficiently forgiving. I perused earlier reviews, which provided lots of useful tips. Make sure to look at them as well. But the instructions are sufficiently detailed, and I would have eventually figured things out of my own. Installing my first mesh took 30-40 minutes, the second one under 20. The result looks clean, and by my third install they are looking professional too (tip: measure the strips beforehand rather than cutting them when applied to the frame so as to get everything perfectly square).I should also say that the company has been a pleasure to deal with. My windows are small (20""x20""), so a kit has sufficient mesh and strips for two windows, but only one set of corners. I didn't want to pay an extra $45 just for four plastic corners. I emailed the seller, and got a very fast response with a couple of reasonable options. One of them worked for me, and we were able to get the requisite materials delivered to my place in 48 hours.

It appeared that during use the quick change bolts that hold the jaws in place can come in contact with fittings complicating the connection process.

3894,"I have gone through way too many garden nozzles and probably read too many articles about the BEST hose nozzle.  This list doesn't appear on any of them but I find it simply the best for myself. I have learned that I don't like wand nozzles (the angle never seems right except for tall tomato plants and they are just heavy), the newly popular firemen nozzles are challenging to use w/the lever that seems great in concept but in execution is just annoying and that few nozzles have a solid, hefty feel (without being too heavy). This is the best of the lot:-Spray adjustment dial is the best.  Easy to adjust to a different pattern but not too loose or too heavy to move. Just feels solid but so smoothly slips to whatever spray pattern you designate-Spray adjustment possibility:  I thought I would love the adjustable spray nozzles where you just turn it up or down but I've since learned that it is not specific enough for the job that I want (w/the exception of the jet spray pattern).  It is impossible to spray your garden vegetables - especially the tender growth during the spring, difficult to fill up the bird bath, etc.  You really need the distinct spray patterns if you're a gardener (or weed picker which I really am).-Trigger:  I purchased this one for this reason alone.  Even though it's not marketed as being for anyone that wants an easier trigger or for those w/arthritis, this nozzle  has the BEST trigger I've ever felt. Easy, smooth and solid. You won't ever have to exert undue pressure to press the trigger or adjust the rotary dial-Love the rubber coating: It's nicer than the all metal ones. Every component of this nozzle exemplifies this - it has heft, each component seems to work/adjust so smoothly but firmly.  One parting advice is if you do use a garden hose frequently, it's worth it to go down to your local hardware or garden supply store and test them.  I like ordering online for many things but there is so much variability w/these nozzles.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

The junction box includes enough caps to seal any unused openings. It also comes with two screws and a slotted metal cross member. This time I mounted a dual security floodlight to the junction box.

4023,"October 5 - update to this review. This company has now sent me three separate emails on three separate days begging and pleading with me to delete my review about this camera that simply does not work. At least half of the time that I try to connect from my office to check on my dogs, it will not connect the entire day. There is no rhyme or reason it just does not work. And to be harassed after posting an honest review and being offered a $10 Amazon gift card to delete this review just shows me what kind of company this really is.I wanted to love this, and if it actually worked, I would. It can capture every angle of my entire living room. Excellent swivel. The problem is, it only works once per day. I can access a view of my living room once. When I close the app and try to look at it again later in the day to monitor my puppy, the app can't connect to the camera. I've tried everything...logging out, restarting my phone, even uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Third day in a row of this frustrating BS where it only works the first time I use it.

4182,"I do like this product, but it wasn't quite as easy to install as I had hoped.  On a 30 year old house with 24"" joist spacing, I found a lot of rock wool above my ceiling.  So it can be messy, be prepared for that.   The brace seemed to walk away from me on the long side - maybe i should have planned to center mount the electrical box?  Anyway, I made a mistake trying to use a cable clamp instead of the supplied grommet strain relief.  That interfered with the saddle clamp.  I discovered this once I decided to climb into the attic to inspect.  One side of the brace had walked nearly to the top of the ceiling joist.  It took a couple of trips into the attic to get the brace set properly, but it wasn't so bad.  I used two hands to tighten the worm-screw shaft, no tools.  The ends of the brace do tend to want to walk away rather than bight in, so you have to keep after them - easier to do with eyes on it.  I don't think I could do it blind (from below ceiling).  I was able to get the brace plenty tight with two hands.  I did use some blue painters tape on the ceiling to keep the electrical box from falling while I was in the attic because you have to remove the saddle clamp while you turn the brace to get it set.  There is a small powerful magnet supplied with this unit for that purpose, but I guess I wanted some insurance.  My attic access was a real bear and I'm not very flexible at my age.  I'd buy this product again.  It's sturdy.  I highly recommend a DC motor ceiling fan, because, you don't need a wall switch, just unswitched power which isn't too tough to find in my attic.  DC fans are ultra quiet.  And remote control is the way to go.  DO REMEMBER TO TURN OFF THE CIRCUIT BREAKER when working with unswitched power.  Use a contactless voltage detector to verify power is off.  some attic tools I used:  knee pads, head light, drop light, small planks to provide a surface for crawling, kneeling, standing, etc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

4200,"The Expert Gardener 4 Twist Nozzle is a very good basic hose nozzle. The nozzle has only one control/adjustment. I like the simplicity of the design and use. The nozzle simply rotates to either shut off all water flow or open up to allow first a narrow high velocity water flow. If you continue to rotate the nozzle it becomes a softer wider angle lower velocity flow of water. With four twists the nozzle goes from closed (no water flow) to full blast. The Expert Gardener 4 Twist Nozzle is quite simple to use and it works effectively. The Nozzle rotation control is the only adjustment. I like the fact that the nozzle does not have a squeeze handle, it keeps things simple. This device is so simple in concept, design and operation there is nothing to dislike. The plastic on the twisting device is soft to the touch and feels good when making rotational adjustments. The Expert Gardener 4 Twist Nozzle is an excellent tool for your garden watering.

4362,"I have recently recieved the ""Expert Gardener 4 Twist Nozzle"" for a water hose from the Walmart Sparks program. It is a pretty good design, doesn't feel cheap or of poor quality. It screws onto any standard hose end. To operate you just twist the end open and choose how you need the water to come out. Depending on how far you twist it, you can set the water pressure to your needs. Twisting it all the way open keeps the water as a stiff stream with a good bit of pressure, keeping it barely open creates a mist of water. The nozzle itself is made out of decent quality brass with grey rubber grip material for easy handling. It's easy to utilize and easy to remove after use. I use these types of nozzles instead of the others with the handles. They tend to jam up and break easily. This brass twist nozzle has never jammed up with me and is practically impossible to break. I have never had any issues with this device and always resort to using this instead of other options offered in stores.

When I scratch tested it, it is white underneath (see pic). The reason it matters. Real brass, if it wears or is scratched, can be polished and look like new. White metal will look horrible with any wear. Also, the flap cover sounds like plastic, when I tap it with something metal, and is warm to the touch. It is not brass either. I would not have bought it if I knew.

The pads are well integrated and do not try to creep off at all. Joining them together as they are designed to do produces a solid clamping situation and is not at all gizmo-ish. I used mine to hold a strait edge across a drywall panel while I cut it with no slippage at all. I also used one to crush down the heavy cardboard box they came in.

4544,"I bought this kit to practice/try replacing screen mesh on an old screen before deciding whether I wanted to tackle replacing the mesh on my sun screens.The fiberglass mesh and spline are good quality, but the spline roller is poor. Also, the rollers on the ends are different, and there is no explanation in the instructions as to when you should/would use end versus the other. I think if you are going to replace more than one screen, it'd be worth investing in a good-quality spline roller.The directions on the package were a little confusing, and the images on the package are too small to help.The video on the HomeDepot product page for using this product features a different spline roller than included in the kit.  I looked online for a video by the company showing how to use this kit and couldn't find one. But there are plenty of videos online that use the type of tool included in the kit that'll help you with the process.The screen material is folded in the bag, and there were fold marks on the fabric after I spread it out over the frame. Because the fold marks were pressed into the fabric from being in the package so long, it was hard to smooth them out when installing the mesh into the frame. I would suggest taking the mesh out and laying or hanging it flat for a day or two for the folds to hang out. I would not iron the mesh as it's fiberglass and could melt. You could also replace the mesh in the screen and let the tension smooth the folds, then take the spline out, stretch the mesh, and reinsert the spline.At any rate, I'm glad I purchased this kit to practice with.

4739,"This camera and the system that goes with it are faulty by design.Consider this for a moment, Blink provides you a 30 day trial for the cloud based subscription, the return window for the product is also 30 days. That is not by coincidence. If you're like me and would like to use this system without the additional cost of a the $100 per year subscription, this camera as well as the Sync Module 2 that is ""designed"" to allow you to use local storage, might as well be paperweights. And, that's no accident. Many of the features that do not require a cloud based service are disabled as soon as the subscription option is eliminated.I learned this because I wanted to use the system without the subscription, and I didn't want to wait 30 days after the trial ended to find out what functionality would no longer be available for use, so I canceled the subscription early.I understand the incentive to offer subscription based products, it's a great business model, but to offer a product whose primary function is so hamstrung as to be unusable once one opts not to subscribe any further, is ingenuine, misleading and does nothing but undermine trust and loyalty in the Blink / Amazon brand.Amazon / Blink, just be honest, it's so much better than manipulating us.Note: this does not even begin to get into the one hour and thirty eight minutes I spent on the phone with two tech support agents, who I ultimately ended up teaching about two subjects they were completely unaware of.One: If you're want to use the Sync Module 2, a USB 2.0 stick won't work, it must be USB 3.0 or higherTwo: If you do subscribe to the cloud service, the warranty on the unit is extended for the full duration of the subscription.Neither agent knew anything about either subject.If you don't want/plan to subscribe to the cloud service, don't buy this.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

4768,"I was a big fan of Wyze and their products until recently. Their intense focus on expanding their product offerings has resulted in taking their ""eye of the ball"" of their bread and butter product, the cam. A few months ago, they sent out a software update for the cameras that was flawed, and they still have not completely corrected it. The problem was that, when the camera detected a sound or motion alert, the clip you are provided to review is missing the first 5 or 6 seconds of recording after the alert was detected. They sent out a software update about a month ago that corrected the sound alert clips, but the motion clips are still not working correctly. If you rely on these cameras to monitor your home or property, be aware of this issue because it will not provide you with complete motion detection monitoring until the software is fixed.I even emailed Elana Fishman, their COO to let her know about the fault and potential liability risk to the company. I did not receive a response and was instead contacted again by Level 1 support who instructed me on how to fallback to a previous release that did not have this malfunction.

I am constantly losing signal to cameras, I can walk across the street to neighbors garage and still have WiFi on my phone/tablet so it's not my WiFi router signal; now even though there is a ""reconnect"" option in the app, it doesn't work.

Why there is an option on the app which doesn't reconnect is beyond me. If I'm not home and able to physically go to the affected camera and push reset, I can't reconnect it until I get home...pretty useless if I was on vacation and unable to manually reset camera.There is no local storage options at all, so if you do not subscribe to a ring plan your cameras are only good for real time viewing.

Nice heft, comfortable low-slip grip, doesn't leak at the hose connection and is very responsive, from a nice soft cone pattern to a perfectly-focused jet. The sprayer has threads on the end (with an open cap to cover/protect them) - apparently Gilmour has some attachments for this sprayer (search Gilmour model 5501), but none looked especially useful to me. What I DO expect to get some use from is the LIFETIME WARRANTY on this sprayer. I've never seen a pistol-grip hose sprayer that was worth a flip after a year or three so if Gilmour is going to stand behind this one forever, I hardly see how I can go wrong. One issue I did have is that mine leaked annoyingly from the front nozzle. I nearly returned it to the store but decided to try and tighten the brass core first.

We bought this and installed, seemed to work well at first, then we left the house and came back to a terrible smell and noticed the bowl was dry. We flushed, and within 10 mins, you could see the water level in the bowl go down. This is a vacation home and no one here 24/7 to monitor toilet water so we uninstalled and returned for a better brand that we didn't have to worry about. Unless you want to install, uninstall, make another trip to Lowe's and then reinstall a different toilet, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this toilet!!! The tp in the pic is not used. Husband just threw it in and flushed, the tp did not flush all the way. That's another thing. Poor flush.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

I was afraid for the price this nozzle would be leaky and plastic-y but it's not, it's wonderful. So much better than the nozzle we left. Our old nozzle leaked and water would run down my arm making watering a pain. This nozzle does not leak and works great. Just twist the dial for different watering options, sprinkle, jet, shower, etc. There is a latch that flips down to keep the water on so you don't have to squeeze the handle continuously. There is also a brass adjustment at the top so if the water doesn't stop completely when you release the handle, just twist the top nut back a rotation or two and that should work. I can't believe I'm reviewing a nozzle, but it really is great. Lightweight, ergonomically friendly and no leaks. Would make a great housewarming gift!See more",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1

5640,Over the years I have tried and used many types of hose nozzles here at my home in Florida. I have a pool and lots of plants on my pool deck and in flower beds in my yard. I was very interested to get and try this 8-pattern nozzle for the many types of water uses/projects I have here. The first thing I noticed and liked was the on/off valve was quite different than most nozzles I have used in the past. Very easy to use with just your thumb to open and close the water flow and get it to the just needed volume of water. The mist and shower patterns were perfect for watering my plants. The jet and full nozzles were great for washing off my pool deck and pool cage screens. So am am quite pleased and impressed with this nozzle.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

I played with it to make sure it released as it should. The pex rings were behind my furnace. Of course it has to be a tight spot and the tool locked up on me all four tumes.

6077,"This couldn't be any simpler to install. Since most of our landscape is shrubs and trees that are watered by drip system, I just about overlooked a secondary use for this item. We keep a bed of dry mulch on the surface of all of our shrub and tree areas. We also live very near the forest service boundary and have had our share of fires. I'm always concerned about the dry mulch picking up a hot ember, so when a nearby fire occurs I like to soak down the mulch. I strategically placed this sprinkler where it will water most of the mulch area near our house. I'll probably add another at some point. The quick coupler system makes it fast and easy to attach the hose and get it up and running. One thing to be aware of and to be sure to plan accordingly, the upright hose will block a portion of the spray if it ends up being in the selected spray zone. Plan this out so the connection is to the rear of the area you plan to water. A 90 degree adapter could prove useful in certain situations to keep the hose horizontal below the spray zone. With our pressure it waters a distance of almost 40 feet. Out of sight, out of mind when not needed.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

All of my pex are cut on an angle. I tried adjusting the blade but no use. Definitely recommend buying another set.Original reviews*******The mesh case is of good quality as are the cutters. The crimp rings will serve their purpose as far as I can tell.Where this set falls flat is the crimpers. Apparently I didn't realize the amount of strength required to actually crimp a ring with these. As another reviewer said, you need a 3rd hand. Your hands will be on the ends of the crimper, which are spread a reasonable distance apart. The difficult part comes when trying to squeeze the handles together to crimp. The motion is similar to bolt cutters, and you're met with a lot of resistance. To make things more difficult, the ring can move around on the pex pipe when you're trying to crimp it. And the space where the crimp ring tab goes is pretty close to the size of the tab so there isn't a whole lot of room for error.If I had to do it again, I would either go the copper ring crimp route or a 1-handed crimp tool. Even some of those have their problems, but at least it would be much easier to crimp rings than with these.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is not a very strong stream of water when in the full position or the jet position.

6121,"This box is really handy. I remodel rental houses. On a regular basis, I find bathroom lights that were wired without a jbox, just romex sticking through the drywall. When you try to add a box, there is a PVC vent from the sink, stud, or other obstruction that makes centering the light over the sink impossible. This solves the problem. In a minute. Just cut the hole where ever you want it. As long as you can get the wire to some part of the box, you are good to go. The box is only as deep as the drywall thickness. Since it is connected to the clamp with only a center bolt, you can also rotate the box after installation and get the box just right for whatever fixture you will be installing.It is also well built, feels heavy Duty.

We needed something temporary to allow us to open them up while we save up to replace the old windows. I was doubtful that the magnets and adhesive would hold up, but they are holding on strong. Even with my cat perched on the window putting pressure against the screen it holds up. Installation was straight forward, but due to the nature of my old window frame it was a tight fit to try and set up the screen on the magnet. I had to set the screen up on my table then bring over to the frame and adjust as necessary. Set 4 of them up rather fast.
