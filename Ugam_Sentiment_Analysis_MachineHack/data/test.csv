0,Made of very thin cheap metal broke on very first crimp.Had to rush to local hardware store spend 60 more on another because water was shut off in my home.Did not return because using case for the new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"As good as the brand names, no jams or misfires on my Paslode fuel cell nailer or on my Banks (HF) nailer.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"unit was easy to use, with understandable in structions.",,,,,,,,,,,,
3,I am the new family plumber. Works well. No problems changing out valves in the rental houses.,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Seems to be holding up well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"Bought this last week to fix my screen door-- everything was good except there was no spline roller in the package. Given the Covid situation, a return would probably not have been possible. Fortunately I had an extra on hand from a prior purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"Honestly, I snagged 3 sets when I saw them at Lowe's. The quality of Jorgensen clamps are unmatched, especially for the cost! Great product that I can't recommend enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Good product and quality I used for framing and renailing plywood.,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"We really love our new Project Source toilet!  It flushes quietly, uses little water, sits higher & comfortably.",,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"It's good, does have a little play in the cutting handle but that's minor. I was using it to cut PETG liquid cooling PC tubes. Works pretty good just have to get the alignment right.",,,,,,,,,,,,
10,This product was very easy to install. Worked well on our screen door and windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,Easy to install and great price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"We just bought this toilet and it's great! It's a good size for our bathroom because it's a smaller space, not too big.  Kohler is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for. We have replaced all our toilets with kohler now. Very happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,
13,Works like it should,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Very nice , great quality materials",,,,,,,,,,,,
15,It's sprinkling range is very good. But the plastic piece that is needed to set the partial circle range broke off on first use. It still will go the 360Â° range but that's it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,Works much better than the cheep ones,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"BUT i think these are a bit light duty. I have a few of these for medium duty jobs. But I now buy the De' brand, much stronger for the extra money. Good starter set for the price though, IMO. Very annoying to have to search for the size of these, Sh B in the title AND description.  Calling them ""MINI clamp set"" can't be helping sales any either, again IMO.Quick tip: someone wrote about the KICKBACK when hitting the pressure release trigger. That can be quite stinging!  I find that if you squeeze the handle a bit it makes releasing the pressure effortless. Best done with 2 hands if possible.  Don't mention it, hehe!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"Could not be happier with my purchase. Very good fabric, very comfortable to sit on.",,,,,,,,,,,,
19,Nest has the best cameras indoor or outdoor. The indoor is giving person alerts when my curtains blow. Other than that it's the best security camera for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,C clamp works great. I use it almost every day.,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,This is my second purchase of the Meinor 5- Pattern Watering Nozzle. No complaints price is right.,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"Wow. I was so impressed with these! They hold everything so tightly without damaging or denting the wood! I love the tightening grip and release is fantastic.They seem pretty durable so far, but if they ever were to break, I would not hesitate to order another pack. They have quickly become my favorite clamps in my workshop!",,,,,,,,,,,,
23,Easy to assemble. Long lasting effects!,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,Tool works easy. The fitting are a little loose. They will not hold themselves in place. The good ones will hold themselves in place making there placement and using the tool a little easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"Nice quality Camera with a poor design.  USB cord end on camera is 3/4 round so you need to drill a 3/4 hole through wall to run a 1/4 cable. Really doesn't make sense and if you cut cable to not drill such a large hole, camera warranty is voided. Also magnetic mount options dont work well on round end.  But picture quality is great.",,,,,,,,,,,,
26,Good for light duty service.,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,They don't work broke on the first day about 15 Apollo rings and that's is,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"Was hoping for enough force multiplication to enable my arthritic wrists to be able to successfully pinch the one inch size clamps.  Unfortunately it was minimal help, even using two very painful hands.Tool may be fine if you still have enough grip strength left.The low value score is the value to me.  It was a completely wasted purchase on my part.",,,,,,,,,,,,
29,"As people are starting to figure out that thing's bought online are cheaper, this product did what I needed it to do and saved me Money...I love money",,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"Great Price for what this little beauty does, the swivel helps to have the right orientation with the task at hand",,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"The color is beautiful and they look nice replacing cushions in a 7 year old Hampton Bay patio set. The backs are a little short, but it seems that all the backs in replacement cushions are shorter nowadays. The seem to be a decent quality and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is there are some threads hanging out from different seems that need to be trimmed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"spline is too small for my old screen door grove, it I had to use the old one",,,,,,,,,,,,
33,Worked perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,Fits and works great but found it for less,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,Toilet is perfect height.  I've found you need to hold down 2-3 seconds to get good flush.,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,Wow this is what I exactly looking for. No unwanted setting. Smooth water flow perfect for watering plants,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"I purchased these to help me with building new box columns for my porch. They were large enough, and strong enough, to help align the sides before nailing.",,,,,,,,,,,,
38,These are super handy and so cheap!,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"I used this to separate the drainage layer from the substrate for a large reptile enclosure. Does the job perfectly, and for a fraction of the price I'd have paid for the same thing sold in smaller quantities by pet suppliers. Cut easily with scissors, but feels sturdy enough that my tegu shouldn't be able to dig through. Very pleased with my purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,
40,I bought a number of these clamps for my woodworking projects. I like to refurbish furniture and also I do a lot of projects that require gluing wood together and these clamps work perfect. They are very easy to use and do a great job of holding wood together.,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,Easy to install and add to existing Blink cameras.,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,"Great easy to use app, add new devices by simply scanning a QRC code. Sets up in a couple of minutes. Nice customizable control settings for motion detection zones, lights, video, & notifications. You can link devices so if one device detects motion other devices will start recording. Linking chimes are easy the app even gives you device health status. Easy to snooze motion if you are working outside. You can manually turn on the lights and a siren too if you like. Easy to replay and save videos. I like the people only motion sensitivity mode but not the color night vision. It makes the video look odd with the colors added.1. The installation is easy and instructions are accurate. Well thought out, except for one glaring omission. I would bet most people who buy the Wired camera drill a hole through the house and plug it in at the garage door opener outlet. The problem is that the plug is Giant and Nobody wants to drill a Giant hole (probably at least 11/4 "") in their wall to pull the plug through for a small cable. Ring should be able to figure this out themselves, maybe with a quick connect/disconnect on the cord near the plug? You really need to practice installing these in real world situations Ring.I was able to figure this out myself by removing 4 small screws from the light base and pull off the cover. There you see the +/- power leads and remove the 2 really small screws holding them down. Remove the 2 really tiny screws that holds a small metal bracket that attaches the cable to the base and pull the cable out. From here you only need to drill a 1/2"" to 5/8"" max hole through your house. Slide the cable through the wall then reassemble in reverse order without losing any of the tiny screws.2. When I went to register my new device for the free 30 day trial their system put my existing device on the trial ( I have the one year paid subscription on that one) and showed the new device not on any trial or plan. I chatted with Ring twice about the issue and they agreed that their system didn't work correctly, but they could never resolve the issue. So I got screwed out of the free 30 day trial.",,,,,,,,,,,,
43,I brought this for dad. It's easy to use. It's versatility and practical. Great gift for dad.,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,This hose is awesome. It doesn't kink up and it's very easy to move around. Not heavy at all. Like that the dogs can't chew through it. Highly recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"After 3 other brand of cam's, this one takes the cake for overall performance in video quality, style and toughness. It literally took me longer to unbox this devices after steering at it in aww than it took me to link it up to my other Nest cams in the Nest app. I can't wait to add a few more around the house. Out with the old, in with the new.",,,,,,,,,,,,
46,use in the garden. Fits the bionic hose great,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,dull blade. not clean cuts. ended up in the trash can.,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"I wanted to like these. They were just the color I was looking for and the foam inserts seemed substantial because they were 5 inches thick and the fabric was sturdy.  But after putting them in the chairs and sitting on them for an hour they were wrinkly as if the foam wasn't large enough and/or thick enough. They looked terrible and sitting on them was uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, I had already taken all the tags off and gave away the old cushions so I'm stuck with them.",,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"This toilet is attractive, easy to clean, and never seems to get plugged.",,,,,,,,,,,,
50,Works great no problem so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"These clamps work very well. They clamp strong and stay tight while in use. When using all four I can set a piece down on the clamps and they hold strong. Tightening works well one handed, but it is tough to loosen evenly with one hand. The rubber clamp heads don't damage pieces and are wide enough to grip two boards. They feel solid and I don't think they will break any time soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,
52,great that it has three sizes so you don't have to buy way more than you will use in most cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,"Good, solid construction. All settings works fine except for the jet stream. The shower setting is perfect for watering all the shrubs in my front yard. Happy with this purchase.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
54,The nail strips were bent some like they were dropped a few time or something. normaly I don't have an issue with these nails.,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,Great quality product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,Make the Adirondack chairs very comfortable! Well made and stylish!,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,They look nice but the cusion material is terrible.  Don't waste your money.,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,Perfect execution with no jams. DeWalt is the standard,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,"This was perfect for fitting a small window in an older house, can be easily screwed into existing frame and using a 3/4"" Pipe foam insulation to seal out bugs on the closed window side.",,,,,,,,,,,,
60,"Really well constructed and heavy duty. But...After I got them out of the box I went to open the latch covering the outlets. There is obviously a small opening to lift them open, but they wouldn't budge. I tried a few plastic things as levers to try and pry them open, but still wouldn't budge. Finally i shot an email off to the manufacturer telling them I give up and would they tell me the trick. I got a reply almost immediately. Apparently nobody can get them open, and everybody ends up calling or emailing this guy.You'll need a screwdriver and some electrical tape. Cover the tip of the driver with some tape to keep from scratching it, and then pry it open. Don't be shy, I bought two and they both took more force than I would have expected.",,,,,,,,,,,,
61,"I am hoping the foam holds up. These are the perfect color and size for my screen porch furniture. For now, I am quite happy. Check with me again in6 months :)",,,,,,,,,,,,
62,Heavy Duty is a great descriptor for this sprinkler. It's mostly made of metal. There's some plastic in the gearing section and that water tight area that will suffer but the rest is made of metal. The base is cast and the sprinkler arm is an extrusion. The water jets are brass. This is all really nice for longevity.I like the adjustments and find this sprinkler works just as well as the old plastic one it replaces only it's definitely more adjustable. I try to isolate the areas that I cover with varying water pressure at the spigot but this Expert Gardner lets you make that adjustment right on the housing.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,Great product!! Worked well on job site!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,love this lawn sprinkler. you can use it with different options and easily manuvered,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"This easily sliced off the old faucet head that was compression fit to my pex and not attached to the outside wall. I replaced it with a shark byte faucet, that after sliding on, attached to the wall with screws. Now I have a secure hose bib, attached to my wall, and it doesn't leak. Shark Byte rocks. I've also used SB to go from pex to copper to give me some backbone behind the shower head. Good company.",,,,,,,,,,,,
66,"Easy to use, sharp works well",,,,,,,,,,,,
67,"Used to cut 1"" SCH 40 PVC. Easy to use! Sturdy! Well made!",,,,,,,,,,,,
68,"We purchased this material for use in large screens (60""x55"") for our screened in patio and thus far seems to do a great job keeping out insects.",,,,,,,,,,,,
69,Work well with metabo frame nail gun,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,This toilet is glazed all over. I have 2 AmericanThis toilet is glazed all over.  We have 2 other toilets that are made in China & they are not. I have to clean them  every other day.,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,Looks nice and seems sturdy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"Do not purchase this cushion! Not worth 1 point. The foam used is not what was advertised, nor does it fit well. It was a $130+ And is not worth $10.00. So disappointing.",,,,,,,,,,,,
73,I love the pattern and the colors! BH,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,This has worked very well with my new Hunter ceiling fan. My old ceiling fan box needed to be changed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"Great sprinkler, liked the deep green color. It also has the quick connect for hose and a swirly sprinkler attachment . Will buy another one soon",,,,,,,,,,,,
76,Very simple to use in the tightest places awesome tool.,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,I used several of these to surface mount electrical switches in my garage and they worked very well for that. There's a variety of plates that one can purchase for these depending on what you use them for. They look good if your into the industrial look as they aren't a finished utility box.,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"Efficient, works great.",,,,,,,,,,,,
79,Thanks. It looks great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,A wonderful and comfortable throne to spend hours reading on.,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,These are not quality cushions. There is no support in the seat part of the cushion.  You feel like you are sitting on the base of the furniture.,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,I used this tool and was very pleased with the performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,Worked very well for the application that I needed it for.,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"I definitely got a different sprinkler than what's pictured in the photos, mine is a dark green and very lightweight plastic. Thankfully I got it on lightening deal so I guess I got what I paid for. Would not spend full price on this.",,,,,,,,,,,,
85,I needed some quality inexpensive clamps (2)  to hold a straight edge for my circular saw.  These did the trick.  Easy to lock down and release.,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,Really like Ring products in general. This install went easy as long as you have an outlet close enough if not try the battery option which I don't have an opinion on since I haven't tried it. As like other Ring products it will walk you through connecting to your WiFi. I did test for WiFi connection from another farther location by just plugging camera into power source before mounting camera and found out the WiFi connection wasn't reliable enough. Went with closer and better WiFi connection. Over all easy mounting all the hardware you need included. Ring makes it very easy to install their products even for the novice which includes myself which is why I like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,I enjoy the one piece. Very comfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,Solid construction with multiple size knockouts. Should last forever.,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,"My camera is about 3 1/2Yrs old and has worked well until this past couple weeks. Suddenly I noticed I'm no longer getting motion detection alerts I would normally get and then noticed the images are fuzzy. Thinking the lens had gotten dirty, I got on my ladder to clean it. Low and behold, the lens is completely destroyed, apparently by exposure to UV. Two things stand out to me:1. Prior to buying, I specifically asked Ring Tech Support if these cameras would be damaged by our Arizona UV and was assured this would not be a problem.2. Ring apparently uses polymer lenses in their cameras intended for exterior use. I find this unacceptable, especially give my experience at 3 1/2yrs in. See pictures. Although I've been fairly happy with Ring, I cannot recommend this camera for exterior use and will now have to migrate my home over to something that is UV tolerant. BTW, this lens was never cleaned with anything other than a damp cloth, no chemicals whatsoever.",,,,,,,,,,,,
90,Only screen material resistant to damage by pets and children.,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,The fiberglass screening seems durable and worked well for replacing several screens. Now I have to wait and see now well it holds up. It really keeps the small gnats out which go through regular screening.,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,Hard to keep cuts at 90 degrees.,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,I used this to mount a chandelier over our kitchen island and it actually wasn't the ideal box to use but I made it work and it's quit sturdy. I mounted it to the side of the 2 x 4 ceiling rafter by drilling two holes near the edge of the top of the box and put screws in the stud at an angle.,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,Better quality than i expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,Perfect fit for my bench and colour stays true. Very happy,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"High quality drawn electrical box from RACO, you can't go wrong. Great price from the Home Depot!",,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"The product is easy to install, durable, and the price is very reasonable. In addition, there is enough screen to do several windows. A good buy!",,,,,,,,,,,,
98,Easy install. Quick start up. VERY helpful for apartment living!,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,I absolutely love this magnetic screen door. It's perfect to keep those nasty bugs out and easy enough my small children and my dog can go in and out with ease. It was easy to install on the door as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,"We purchased this toilet to replace an older one that was too low.  We like the design and are familiar with the Kohler brand. We have 2 other Kohler toilets, Memoirs style, but they were too long for a proper fit. We also have 3 Kohler brand bathroom sinks and a kitchen sink. The directions for installation of the tank to the bowl are seriously lacking and were of no help. It has the new flush system and that is fine, once the tank is installed!  However, several Youtube videos later and trial and error were required to figure out how to compress the rubber washers (?) enough for the bolt to be long enough to go through them into the holes in the tank and attach the tank to the bowl. Extremely poor directions but once installed the toilet works fine and meets our expectations. Would I buy one again? Probably but we now know the directions are worthless and how to fix the problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,
101,I have used these clamp for many years. Cheaper models have a course thread patern and it is difficult to tighten exacly the amount you want. Pony clamps have a finer thread and thus you can tighten the clamps to the right amount. I go out of my way to get these clamps. The new bigger rubber handle is good as well. I have many that are so old they have a wooden handle on them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,"These have been great clamps with many uses and I never have enough Hands. I find myself buying some sort of Clamp, Every time I go to HF. They are just so good to have handy in my shop.",,,,,,,,,,,,
103,YES.   Fantastic products.  Used pex for running my air supply thru out my barn.  Both the 1 hand clamp tool and the clamps worked out perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,"Apparently Ring has a way of interrupting connectivity to the cameras to force you to subscribe to their service. I say this because the cameras worked fine up to the end of the trial period, but started acting up immediately afterwards with extremely slow connectivity. Now that I spent $100 on the annual subscribtion the cameras magically work again. I didn't even get the $20 discount that was advertised with the annual subscription. The cameras are already expensive, so I believe this is definitely unfair practices.",,,,,,,,,,,,
105,"No clog,,,, Good flush,,,, Nice look",,,,,,,,,,,,
106,good quality and dries fast,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,easy to install on doors or windows,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,was very impressed live in a rural area not great water pressure and this nozzle did great job blasting my sump basin clean it pulsates to really blast gunk off the thumb control it’s handy controlling the water pressure when you need it it does blast water everywhere so don’t stand to close the handle feels well built and like it will last but we willSee,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,work just great for trim work,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,Do not work in milwaukee brad nailer.,,,,,,,,,,,,
111,Great product. Quality materials.,,,,,,,,,,,,
112,"Once I figured out how it works, it works like a dream. Does anyone actually read directions? Very sturdy and very simple to use. mounted it. changed the design and removed and re-mounted it. Easy-Peasy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
113,"It works but not the best to water your grass. It is quiet and easy to use. When daisy chaining, the pressure lowers on the second unit, obviously. I see myself using this when the kids want to play with water on hot days. Of you have a small garden then this is ideal",,,,,,,,,,,,
114,It broke after not much usageSee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
115,"Quality classic brass construction! No leaks, easy to use, solid, classic simple design. No more plastic!!! This one will last. Im buying a second for the front yard.LikesEase of useConstructionQualityDesignSturdinessHandleValue for moneyPressureSee more",,,,,,,,,,,,
116,its higher up and easier to stand up since I have bad knees and it works like a charm,,,,,,,,,,,,
117,Installs easily and is very sturdy when fully extended.,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,"Cushions are well made, 6"" thickness makes for a comfortable seat, lime color of material is a great pop of color. Looking forward to the arrival of the multi colored lumbar purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,
119,"I paid top $$ for this Orbit brand wand to water my gardens, and it soon began leaking from both cup flanges, upper and lower. When I tried to tighten them, the flimsy plastic on one cracked and water squirted sideways.  I put a hose clamp around it to no avail.  Meanwhile the top flange was still leaking and the slide-trigger quit functioning.  Trash !!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
120,Great clamps. The only aggravation is the protective plastic/rubber pads come off too easily. Any deflected clamping results in the pad slipping off the clamp.,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,Pretty heavy duty. Quick release is nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,
122,"My husband and I just installed this today. He did most of the work :-) Although it was very easy. Our door is an outward swing door so I searched a long time before choosing this one and it seems that it will work well and looks nice. We shall see. If when the weather shifts and the wind picks up I find out differently I will adjust my review. For now, I am happy and feel satisfied it will work as it says it does. Thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,
123,This is the best hose nozzle that I ever had. I can control the water flow without changing the spray pattern. I can leave it on when filling a bucket or small pool. It is easy to handle. Well done.,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,Tough screen with good visibility and clean look. Highly recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
125,"good cameras but Blink service is a negative 5, I bought a years service and after 30 day trial, said no recording because I didn't have a plan , they have no customer service number that you can call and this is second month they have not recorded and still saying I have no plan but they gladly took my payment for a years service",,,,,,,,,,,,
126,"I was surprised by the strength it has with everything and being so small, used from other brands but this is the best",,,,,,,,,,,,
127,Easy to use and control the pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,
128,"The first one broke the day that I purchased it. It rotated itself so far that it became stuck with the jet upsidedown and spraying jnto the dirt. The replacement that I recieved when i returned the first one broke in the days, it stopped oscillating and wont budge. Waste of money.",,,,,,,,,,,,
129,"It was easy to install, but the adhesive had a tendency to stick to the film instead of the screen, so be careful and watch when you peel it off. It is more noticeable because it is darker than the screen",,,,,,,,,,,,
130,"These cameras work very well. I would give 5 stars if they worked thru windows to record at night but they do not. The picture quality is great. Set-up unbelievably simple... literally took less than a minute. Even though they do not work well for what I wanted, I think I will keep them. They do record great during the day from my windows and I will continue looking for a window mount camera for night-time use. These cameras work better than the Blink camera I have and as well, or better picture quality than our Ring doorbell.",,,,,,,,,,,,
131,"I needed a tool for a small job with 3/4"" PEX. This tool worked very nicely. First time I worked with PEX. No problems, no leaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,
132,Excellent performance and durability in a smaller design format.,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,"I bought this to cut 1 1/4"" PVC pipe since it says it should cut pipe up to that size.  It is my first time using one of these so I tested it on some old 1/2"" PVC and it did fine.  When I went to cut the 1 1/4"" PVC the tool didn't open up far enough to get around the pipe and cut it.  I youtube'd videos (since there are no instructions with it), went to Irwin's website, and found nothing about adjustments or why it wouldn't fit the 1 1/4"" pipe.  After trying various ways to get the pipe to fit, I couldn't get it and it will not cut if the pipe is not fully in there.  I plan to return it and get the larger sized cutter.  3 stars because it did work, but not on everything it said it would.",,,,,,,,,,,,
134,The sprinkler fails to rotate after a few days of use. Even using higher water pressure doesn't get the head to turn. Don't buy this one. It's better to invest in a higher quality sprinkler.,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,The screen is wonderful however the rubber gasket part that you push into the door is not long enough for traditional side slider I had to use part of the old gasket to complete the job,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,"These Brads work very well, they don't seem to bend over as do some lesser brands , being made from a Grade 50 steel makes a big difference",,,,,,,,,,,,
137,Wife loves it. Makes watering the rear of the flower beds so easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
138,Where has this sprinkler been my whole life? It is adjustable to any shape/size. It only requires a little water pressure to give a huge spray and I think saves a lot of water.,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,This sprayer is very simple and small so is easyTo grip it has a adjustable spray and a constantOn tab the pressure is strong to reach yard areasTo pin pointSee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,"Saw this toilet in the local store and purchased 4 because of the discounted price.  When i went to install the first toilet, I saw that the hardware (nuts) used to install the toilet tank to the bowl as well as the toilet to the floor was plastic.  This is a really bad idea.  I am a contractor so I can see where I would be getting callbacks regarding issues including up to possible flooding damage with these plastic nuts stripping/breaking over time so I packed the toilet up and returned all 4.  It may have saved a couple of pennies to use plastic nuts but brass nuts need to be used in to make sure there are no long term issues with the plastic nuts stripping/breaking over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
141,Great product easy installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,This is exactly what I needed to help hold down boards when trying to use the kreg drill tool by myself. And great price - I bought several. Very easy quick release and clamps hold strong. .,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,Works great with ceiling fans! Strong box for hanging fans!,,,,,,,,,,,,
144,"Where were the extra adapter and connecting piece? I did not receive the extra parts described. Fortunately, I had my own brass quick-connecting adapters but highly disappointed not receiving items as described.",,,,,,,,,,,,
145,"Great tool. Works well in tight spots. I wish I could lock a ring in the jaws, and move the ring to its appropriate place on the pipe. Too often I have every thing lined up and the pipe slips. Ok sometimes it is me fidgeting! Either way I have to start the connection over.",,,,,,,,,,,,
146,"What an amazing crimp tool for PEX. Highly recommend! It is versatile, easy to use, and great LED indicator that lights up whenever you are in a tight space to help you make sure the crimp is secure.",,,,,,,,,,,,
147,"I just finished my 3rd PEX plumbing project with this kit, The plier and stainless steel rings match very well, and the value is incredible. I will never hesitate to recommend this product. Nice clamp, nice deal.",,,,,,,,,,,,
148,Very easy to use. Works great in tight places.,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,"Simple, easy installation and setup.",,,,,,,,,,,,
150,Easy and convenient.,,,,,,,,,,,,
151,these were very nice but did not fit my chairs,,,,,,,,,,,,
152,These are the handiest clips. I use them inside and out to hold things together and they are strong and durable. And when I need to glue some thing I pull out a clip and it holds the item until the glue dries. I didn't realize how many uses they had. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,
153,Worked well for the intended purpose. Would have rated it higher but it was kind of difficult to get straight and even. Should also have holes in mount lug for screw. I drilled it. Overall a good item.,,,,,,,,,,,,
154,We were so impressed with our first one we bought this second one to upgrade our second bathroom. We like the increased height which is more comfortable and we have not had to use a plunger since.,,,,,,,,,,,,
155,Shot water every but my lawn.  No setting to control the height of the water. Was basically useless for the small patch of lawn I was trying to water,,,,,,,,,,,,
156,"Makes cutting 1/2"" pex tubing very quick and easy with clean cuts.  I would buy again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
157,"Excellent product, easy installation, and great performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,
158,These are great quality. I used them to glue a piece of wood back to my fireplace and they worked like a charm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
159,"This screen was heavier than I thought, but still was easy to cut with a new utility knife and install",,,,,,,,,,,,
160,Less than 5 minute setup. Works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
161,"I really was not sure if this nozzle would last or not due to it's price. I've now used it all summer and amvery pleased. It fits well in the hand, it is made very well and it works great. I like the price also since I do liketo change out my hoses and nozzles yearly. Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,
162,"Purchased 2 of the Cimarrons to replace the 30 yr old toilets as part of a remodeling project. They were installed by a plumber and required some shiming to eliminate the wobble from the tile flooring. Operationally, I'm disappointed in the flush performance- these toilets require you to hold down the handle for 4-5 seconds in order for the tank to empty. Unlike the old flapper style, this ""cannister"" design drops and shuts off the water flow as soon as you release the handle. It's going to be embarrassing having to explain to guests how to operate the toilet correctly. Also, as noted in other reviews, the black hose that runs from the valve to the cannister needs to be shortened an inch or so, or the hose will kink and prevent water from filling the bowl after flushing.",,,,,,,,,,,,
163,"When you compared this basic oscillating sprinkler with others around the same price, it is better build and works just as well. The heavier base helps it not flip over everytime I adjust the hose. It will operate at higher or lower pressure a from the tap. I would get this again in the future, only time will tell how long it will last for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,
164,"The screen was already coming apart when we got it, not the best, but for the price I guess it was okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
165,This product is not able to turn on and be used with out some other stupid piece that you have to buy and plug in and sync to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
166,Works great in my brad gun,,,,,,,,,,,,
167,They came in already assembled and just had to pop them in the window. Super easy and convenient,,,,,,,,,,,,
168,"Screen came inside a tube in a box. NO damage! Thanks, HomeDepot",,,,,,,,,,,,
169,"works great, great image quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,
170,Works great for my installation PEX air lines in my garage.,,,,,,,,,,,,
171,"Replaced 4 screens, very happy with the quality of the product.",,,,,,,,,,,,
172,Good product for the price.  Flushing mechanism feels a little cheap but works very well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
173,I have replaced this sprinkler 3 times. The gears stop operating and the sprinkler will not oscillate.,,,,,,,,,,,,
174,I was washing my car and dropped it on the ground and it never stopped leaking from the tip of the nozzle from then on. Threw it in the trash!,,,,,,,,,,,,
175,"Super easy to install! Took about 15-20 to measure, cut, and put together. Instructions are easy to follow. Hasn't budged since I put it up about a week ago even with strong winds.",,,,,,,,,,,,
176,Always flushes immediately and easy to clean and stays clean:),,,,,,,,,,,,
177,"Very well made clamp for the price point. Really like that has the 36"" jaw opening.",,,,,,,,,,,,
178,"Great toilet, easy two-piece design to put together, very easy to install, and the flushing unit is awesome. washes the whole side of the bowl, unlike normal toilets that just dribble water down the sides. Love it.                                                                                                                                       Thanks, Jim",,,,,,,,,,,,
179,works great for what I needed. Using two on top of a tall pole to water a garden. They are being fees by a pond higher up above the garden. The plastic allows them to work with the low water pressure from being gravity feed from the pond. Metals were to heavy and didn't turn like they should.,,,,,,,,,,,,
180,VERY EASY TO USE AND POWERFUL,,,,,,,,,,,,
181,These worked just as i expected them to.  Good quality and price is good for the amount of nails you receive.,,,,,,,,,,,,
182,"Perfect fit, looks great",,,,,,,,,,,,
183,These clamps are not durable and break very easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,
184,"I have to return this toilet because it doesn't fit into the old toilet space, even though the old one is also a Kohler comfort height. I wouldn't order this online, you'd better go to the store with measurements...my space was 1.5 inches too short for the water line and the wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,
185,Orange grippers come off very easily but product still functions,,,,,,,,,,,,
186,I had a small job to do with PEX plumbing. This cutter made quick straight cuts. Worth the money.,,,,,,,,,,,,
187,Fit tight and perfect - easy to trim.,,,,,,,,,,,,
188,Nice cushions but even indirect sunlight fades the color badly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
189,These clamps are very strong and well made. I will be reordering.,,,,,,,,,,,,
190,Perfect for the Job.  Fits in all finish nailers.  outstanding!,,,,,,,,,,,,
191,"item was good came with all the required items ad displayed, was super easy to use and set up alone. will definitely recommend if u are needing to replace window mesh.",,,,,,,,,,,,
192,Outside waterline. Worked well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
193,Shipped quickly. Tool feels well built.,,,,,,,,,,,,
194,High quality. Much better without all of the fancy gizmos on other nozzles.  After a few t year they stop working,,,,,,,,,,,,
195,Loved the concept of this sprinkler as we have some very oddly shaped areas in the lawn.  To get full coverage I needed to be able to daisy chain sprinklers together.  I had two sprinklers on this chain and this one barely threw out 5' with the knobs opened fully.  I expect that it requires substantial water pressure in order to work as expected.  The plastic spike is ok--if your soil is hard they won't last.I recommend the Orbit H2O for most consistent coverage and ability to chain together.,,,,,,,,,,,,
196,The seats are a little on the small size. The short flush requires that you hold it down a little longer than I'd expected.  The tank cove moves out of alignment easily. It looks great.I wouldn't buy it again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
197,Really good quality product easy to set up took about 10 -15 minutes .,,,,,,,,,,,,
198,Very easy to use did the job can't wait to do more pex work and use it again,,,,,,,,,,,,
199,"Works great, I have arthritis and was able to cut PVC pipe.",,,,,,,,,,,,
200,Excellent buy! Cushion is thick and supportive. Looks and feels great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
201,"I needed to patch a small section (32"" x 79"", of my Patio Screen. The quality of this screen is very poor. My splining tool caused the screen to tear, even though I tried to be careful, when finished there were two tears near two corners. I had to go to Home Depot to purchase a more durable screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,
202,I was using an old cell phone to keep an eye on my dog when I left home but it would randomly glitch for whatever reason and would sometimes just stop after I was already on my way to work. The price tag of the Nest cameras held me off but I finally couldn't take the unpredictable instability of the system I was using and ended up buying one to try out. The next day I went out and bought another. I wish I had done this sooner. The camera works great even in low (or no) light. I can see the whole...,,,,,,,,,,,,
203,The electrician used it and it fit perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
204,"After using the mother-in-law's extra high toilet I was spoiled and had to have one. After searching this looked like my only option for extra high so I when ahead and purchased. I'm 6'3"" tall and my back hurts first thing in the morning so it's nice not having to squat so much. The mother-in-law is elderly it's much easier for her to stand up using this style. Installation was a breeze. Looks nice and flushes efficiently and surprisingly quiet. Note it doesn't come with a seat like the standard toilet I purchased a week earlier for my other bathroom. Happy with my purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,
205,"Builder grade crap, literally.  Usually takes two flushes as the flushing power is so poor, even for the ladies after a #1, as it often times can't manage to get the tp down.  And, if you #2, be sure you have a brush handy as it sticks like glue (sorry to be graphic).  They were installed in our new house.  Four months later we're replacing them.  It might make a decent planter.  But, as a toilet, it's horrible.  There is a reason why the price is so low.  Pro Flow No Go!",,,,,,,,,,,,
206,"Good price, less expensive than the big home-improvement stores. That's why I purchased here. Would buy again if I needed some, but it is a giant box so it should last a while.",,,,,,,,,,,,
207,This was really easy to install. My front door did not have screens. It had windows you can open up but no room for a screen in the window frame. I was able to install it in less than 20 minutes and adjust the size. It was exactly what I need it because I hate bugs but love a breeze,,,,,,,,,,,,
208,Works great. Secures project.,,,,,,,,,,,,
209,This product comes tightly folded. As soon as you start to install it will crack and break apart at the creases. I've reported to the seller without response. I cannot return as material was already adequately cut before starting the install. Don't waste your time and money as I did and go for screens shipped in rolls not folded.,,,,,,,,,,,,
210,"The size on the tag did not match the actual size of the pillow, however the pillows did fit.  I thought I would have to bring them back.",,,,,,,,,,,,
211,"Tried half a dozen times to connect to hose and each time water spewed out of three places, drenching me in process. Would not waste time or money on such a lousy poorly designed product.",,,,,,,,,,,,
212,"Hey, they fit the gun and work great. I removed one star because the plastic lid is a bear to open--break a nail already!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
213,Perfect!!! Easy to install. This is exactly what I needed for fitting a fan in my living room,,,,,,,,,,,,
214,This magnetic screen was a perfect solution for keeping the mosquito and bugs away. The installation was a breeze and the qualifying of the item is really good compare to the other one I have.,,,,,,,,,,,,
215,The mesh worked exactly as described and perfectly for my task.,,,,,,,,,,,,
216,They were an absolute perfect fit for a window that the cat had made a hole in the screen,,,,,,,,,,,,
217,I wanted a spot light on the side of my house and this worked perfectly. I just followed the instructions and next thing you know I have a light. This worked well for my needs,,,,,,,,,,,,
218,"I had to drill the mounting holes very slightly larger to accommodate the #14-1 1/2"" wood screws I used. I mounted this on my shed's eave to install a SANSI 45w motion security LED light, using the strap that came with the light and the strap screws that came with the box. This particular light uses a single screw through the center of the fixture through the center of the mounting strap. I suppose I could have added some liquid lockwasher to seal the plug threads, but it seemed like overkill. A great little, inexpensive box that did the job perfectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,
219,"I cut approximately 8 pieces of 1/2"" PVC pipe and then the blade cracked into pieces. Sent back for a refund so I can get a different one. Anything but durable.",,,,,,,,,,,,
220,Excellent quality. Perfect replacement for aging screens.,,,,,,,,,,,,
221,"Trying to use spotlight cam on vacation home. Camera went offline. Tech told me that there is no way to reset camera remotely. I had to drive four hours, one way, to reset the camera after a power outage. After I did that, the camera worked for one hour. During over one hour with Tech, he said that the camera was trying to update firmware when it stopped. He promised that the problem was solved and that it would never happen again. The tech said that I needed their WiFi booster even the router was less than ten feet away. I have other manufacturer camera and other WiFi devices that are much further away but have no trouble with them. Very disappointed that there is no way to remotely reset their product.",,,,,,,,,,,,
222,"Nice, easy setup, easy to use",,,,,,,,,,,,
223,cons: camera talkback feature works like walkie-talkies you have to hold the mic button in the app to talk and release to hear the person's response.pros: detect wifi outside better than my phone; woks with Alexa; one app works with all devices; very reliable app so far.; motion detection: sd card callback feature is great; also able to purchase cloud storage in the app - opptional,,,,,,,,,,,,
224,Delivery was good and items worked well,,,,,,,,,,,,
225,perfect. I love the size and color. Work perfectly for me. Suitable for indoor and outdoor,,,,,,,,,,,,
226,"This was the easiest cut I have ever made. Everyone knows that cutting pex isn't hard, but a very close end cut is. This tool made that cut dirt simple. Excellent tool, perfect, just wish it were made in the USA",,,,,,,,,,,,
227,"Good quality, but this will not work on Viega press fittings. Viega has there own $180 crimp tool.",,,,,,,,,,,,
228,This one is great! The lever moves very easily. It's way less awkward than other models.,,,,,,,,,,,,
229,"I used it on an garden hose. It worked great for cutting the hose, cleanly. Definitely worth the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,
230,Made 10 cuts on pvc. Blade is rolling over in 2 spots. It is made in Taiwan. Must be recycled steel. Returning after 1 day's use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
231,"Good product, no jamming, good holding power. This is a quality product and I would purchase them again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
232,Good product it took a little longer to get it due to Covid19.Good value for your money.,,,,,,,,,,,,
233,"Spring clamp. What can I say,  it's a clamp and works very well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
234,"The tool is well made, but I returned it when I could not fit a 1.5-inch pipe. Opening the blade to its maximum to fit the pipe in, the ratchet teeth (visible in the display picture) stick out where the pipe should go and prevent the pipe from seating in the holder. This design makes it impossible to use the tool to cut the 1.5-inch pipe.",,,,,,,,,,,,
235,they are amazing for the price. I will buy more!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
236,Doesn't work unless you have super high water pressure,,,,,,,,,,,,
237,This sprinkler has extremely good spray patterns and versatility.,,,,,,,,,,,,
238,Large size make it useful for clamping swimming pool slide together.,,,,,,,,,,,,
239,Excellent holding strength. Just the job for holding files when tuning skis,,,,,,,,,,,,
240,I don't like this toilet It does not work well. The #1 flush leaves the water yellow and the #2 flush often won't fully flush unless pushed perfectly. I have tried adjusting and it doesn't work. Wasted money on the over priced toilet,,,,,,,,,,,,
241,Very easy and fast! Recommend,,,,,,,,,,,,
242,"Easy to install, and has great battery life",,,,,,,,,,,,
243,"This toilet came up on a search of ADA compatible items and the information calls it ""chair height"" and indicateds that it is good for people with disabilities and/or mobilty issues.  That, to me, means it is a toilet that sits up higher (chair height???).  When I got it home I discovered that the toilet bowl height is 16.5"" not the ADA recommended 20""  Now I have to load it back into the car and return it.  Yuck!  Probably a good toilet if you are not looking for a taller one.",,,,,,,,,,,,
244,"Impact sprinkler. I'm not sure about adjustments and will have to look it up online or just play around with it like most men do, as this didn't come with any instructions, but it does water the lawn. It's size makes it easy to move around and attach to other hoses.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
245,"Not the same faucet I got....the one I got was all dark blue and is horrible...no water pressure getting throu at all, leaks..only thing good is the thumb trigger...still looking for a good one and will definitely pay more for a better nozzle!!See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
246,"This product is trash compared to Nest IQ (last gen cameras). The scrolling of history of camera video in Google Home is awful compared to the Nest app. If you value the video timeline features of the camera (set it apart from others), well, it is terrible now... There is no PC viewing of your security cameras so you cannot monitor you live feeds on a large TV... WOW! The Google Home App is terrible and the new home base for their cameras. Unless they completely redo the UI, I don't see how t...",,,,,,,,,,,,
247,"This two star is not related to performance, it is just that I received an item that had been opened and looks to be previously used. Everything was jammed in box and box was ripped open but then re-taped. I am probably going to return it before install.",,,,,,,,,,,,
248,Golden Rule of Woodworking:  You always have one less clamp than you need.  Corollary:  You never have enough clamps.  I have a lot of 6 &12 inch clamps of varying quality.  These are now my favorites because the handles have some texture that allows you to easily reef them down.  The handles are the only thing that distinguishes them from my Bessey clamps but that is enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,
249,"These are just fine for clamping, the price is right, but I wish I had seen that the sliding clamp side cannot be removed to clamp outward without grinding off the weld nubs at the end of the bar.",,,,,,,,,,,,
250,Quick shipping. Exactly as described. Worked correctly for my outdoor ceiling fan installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
251,Complete kit!  Very easy to use.  Just need a razor blade to trim off the excess screen material.,,,,,,,,,,,,
252,Really like this water hose. The flip top makes it easy to turn off and on. I also like the different patterns.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
253,"I'm retired and do my plumbing repairs at my house. These are easy to use, cut straight and make my repairs a lot easier, especially in tight spaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,
254,This is a great product for remodeling. It doesn't take a lot of room. If you can get the wires to where you need them. Chances are good that this product will fit.,,,,,,,,,,,,
255,"Box is of high quality and met all expectations, but was unusable.  It arrived missing the hardware on one side necessary to secure it in an old work setting (as it's designed to be used).  So, useless.",,,,,,,,,,,,
256,"Durable, nice fabric on well made cushions.",,,,,,,,,,,,
257,"Works good, But the bolts which hold it together protrude.",,,,,,,,,,,,
258,"These have become my go to clamps. They are light and easy to use yet very solid and hold a strong grip. The clamp & release mechanisms work very well. I like them so much that I just ordered a pair of the 24"" Jorgensen clamps.",,,,,,,,,,,,
259,I really like this. Energy and water efficient along with being a little taller. This is good especially for senior citizens,,,,,,,,,,,,
260,These cushions have a beautiful rich color and are very comfortable! They added great color to my existing outdoor furniture.,,,,,,,,,,,,
261,Clean straight easy cuts.  Works as it should with no issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,
262,Easy to install and priced right.,,,,,,,,,,,,
263,These cushions were way above what I thought they would be. They are large enough to cover the entire chair and they are nice and thick and comfortable,,,,,,,,,,,,
264,My old hose handle leaked I needed a new one. This is a great price. I only gave it 4 stars because the power isn't as strong as my old one. The water doesn't shoot nearly as far either on the jet setting. But still great for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
265,The box is high quality and looks nice when surface mounted.,,,,,,,,,,,,
266,Good quality for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
267,Liked the quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,
268,Good quality no see um screening,,,,,,,,,,,,
269,"Solid product, however, the nails were lose in the box.",,,,,,,,,,,,
270,returned it.  did not cut pvc.,,,,,,,,,,,,
271,Bought really like how they looked. Have only used a few times bottom cushion not holding shape. Foam is breaking down. Back pillows also i have had to purchase additional poly-fil as they also are losing shape.,,,,,,,,,,,,
272,"These cushions look so wonderful in our backyard. We chose them because they pick up the colors of the pavers (faded brick red and blue-grey) -- and it's such an appealing pattern anyway. Pleasantly surprised by how very comfortable it is to sit in them. I hope they wear well, but I'm confident!",,,,,,,,,,,,
273,My first purchase was the cheaper easy view screen. I discovered that it was easy view because there was hardly any screen there. The gnats came right through and the screen tore easily. I am completely satisfied with the more expensive fiberglass screen. It is worth the extra buck.,,,,,,,,,,,,
274,"As the title suggest, it was impossible to make straight cut on 1/2"" pex. I did follow the instructions, even watched the video, no matter what I tried the cut was not straight. I returned the tool and bought another one (Waterline Pex cutter) and first attempt was successful.",,,,,,,,,,,,
275,"This is a great affordable option for adding depth to an exterior outlet/switch/electrical box. Easily installed with 4 screws. Does not look as good as using a single deeper electrical box, but is quicker and easier than completely replacing an existing electrical box.",,,,,,,,,,,,
276,"Excellent purchase,,, so easy to set up and use with the app,, not to techy either. Simple.",,,,,,,,,,,,
277,It's quite powerful. I give it 4 stars because it's loud for installing in bathroom. Other than that it's great.,,,,,,,,,,,,

288,"Only had a few fittings to do but worked well, only issue I had was was hard to work in confined space. But overall will bid more jobs with this product in mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,

301,Well constructed and limited lifetime warranty? Who does that? Great product!,,,,,,,,,,,,
302,I needed an inexpensive cutter to consistently cut PVC tubing at work. For the price this works. I own a $60 pvc pipe cutter that exceeds this one but this matches the job that it is needed for. If you occupation is plumbing this is not the tool for you. If you have small projects this works adequately. The release mechanism for the blade could be better,,,,,,,,,,,,
303,Nothing super exciting here...They're clamps...They hold stuff together.Seem to be holding up good after multiple uses and show no signs of wear.I'd buy the same again if I needed more.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pipe immediately broke off clean at the bottom inside the housing like it had been made just to fail. I never even got the chance to turn it on even once. Construction is very thin aluminum. I tried to rebuild it but was impossible without special tools (yes, I have the needed skills & experience).  Did I mention this is VERY thin aluminum?... Dont buy this if you have hard-ish or rocky soil of any type. Regardless, if you do, you may need to treat it like a thin Old-Timey Glass Christmas ornament. Good Luck.",,,,,,,,,,,,

309,"I was very dissatisfied and disappointed in this product. The hose sprayer worked well for about a week, and then began to leak constantly. I ended up more wet than the plants . Buyer beware",,,,,,,,,,,,
310,"Of course this clamp cannot be tightened nearly as much as a normal C clamp but if you need to clamp something a foot away, it will do it. It seems nicely made.",,,,,,,,,,,,
311,"A little too big for the projects I needed it for but really strong. Wished the clamp pads were bigger. Like parallel clamps. Just 2-1 1-2"" space to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
312,Works well in my mini van so that I can get air for my puppies without them sticking their heads out the windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,
313,Never used before and I have to say these are the best ones I have ever purchase and I have four or five other brands.  The grip ad the ease of sliding out and in is perfect.  I will replace the others.,,,,,,,,,,,,

319,Best quality ring busters you can buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
320,"Bought 4 of these pricy box/outlet combos, and none are worth having. None of the screw holes are threaded, and the screws are such low grade that every single screw stripped out trying to drive them in. Finally the threads grabbed on one screw which promptly snapped off in the hole, rendering that box totally useless.Stay far-far away from this product!",,,,,,,,,,,,
321,The screen is attractive and the installation method is relatively simple with the provided tools.,,,,,,,,,,,,
322,"Took a few tries to set up and took a while to install the firmware, but overall was very easy, good product for the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,
323,"Great tool. Hard to use in tight places so make sure you piece together 1st a fitting that needs to go into tight spot 1st, then work outwards.    Enjoyed it being a newbie. I only had 3 rings I had to redo out of near 100 I crimped. I'm proud that I saved money doing it myself",,,,,,,,,,,,

326,"I had some one-handed-squeeze clamps before and I may have squeezed too hard. They broke. These are still working fine for me albeit I may have learned not to squeeze too hard (or maybe I'm just getting too old and loosing my grip strength). Anyway, they are all fine. Also I don't use them for 'super tight' clamping, just as 'extra' hands. Thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,

330,"We were looking for a taller, more powerful toliet that used less water than our 13 year old toilets that were originally installed in our home. We also did not want to spend too much on a new toliet. We have had issues with our previous toilets getting clogged. This toliet has met all of our expectations, so much so we have replaced all our toilets with this model.",,,,,,,,,,,,
331,They are a great fit. The house we rented had no screens in the windows so we use these and they are great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
332,"Recently used these to install two ceiling fans on the porch of a 100-year-old house with no easy access to the joists.  These sat on the topside of the ceiling and locked into the joists on either side, just as advertised, creating a much stronger electrical box connection than a typical old work box.  These are not inexpensive but are highly recommended!",,,,,,,,,,,,
333,This sprinkler is solid metal and I was very happy with the product once I opened it and started using it. Works great. It's a buy again if I had to.,,,,,,,,,,,,
334,Does what it is intended for. Great price!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
335,It works just as I had hoped. Uses less water and is a reasonable quiet flush,,,,,,,,,,,,
336,"Very strong spring grip, wish it were adjustable. Did the job I needed it for.",,,,,,,,,,,,
337,"This heavy duty polymer impact sprinkler is perfect for home use if you have a small or large lawn. I have reduced the lawn area I used to have but this impact sprinkler worked great on even my small lawn area. It has an adjustable dial on the top so that you can determine how far you want the sprinkler to spray. Since my lawn is only about 20' x 20', I moved the dial to the lowest setting and it worked perfect. I did move the dial to the full setting but ended up watering my neighbors lawn as well. The construction seems well built and the bottom of the impact sprinkler is made from what looks like aluminum so it shouldn't rust either. I have only had the sprinkler for about a week and we are getting plenty of rain right now, so I will give it heavier use later in the spring and summer. It covers the entire lawn so I don't have to constantly move the sprinkler from spot to spot like I had to with my old sprinkler. The pictures I included details the dial on the top of the sprinkler. I would recommend this impact sprinkler for your home lawn.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,

349,Like that it's tall and has a lot of power when you flush so everything goes down! Took very little time to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
350,"I bought these after I borrowed a crimper that did all three sizes by changing the jaw. These crimpers are not only great but extremely affordable for two compared to other single sets. I'm not a plumber, I just refuse to pay people to do simple things. Great value and craftsmanship!!",,,,,,,,,,,,

353,"Purchased these to finish a job which I had been using Grip Rite nails. New framing nailer and went through 1000 Grip Rite nails with no feed or jam issues. First strip of these Hitachi nails, double feed and jams. Unfortunately I needed these to finish the fence so waiting for a delivery was not convenient. I regret that now.",,,,,,,,,,,,
354,"The old work box by Steel City is far superior to this box by Raco. Too gimmicky, the flattening of the wings is not the best design. The box will work if you do not have another choice. It is way better than the fiberglass or plastic boxes though.",,,,,,,,,,,,

356,"Ring has thought this through very well. You need basic tools, but this product comes with all the special tools you need. I spent 15 minutes removing the old fixture (cutting/removing caulk while protecting fragile vinyl siding). Even 10 feet up, Ring provides an ""S"" hook to hand the fixture from their mounting plate while you wire it up...genius. I already had a Ring doorbell and the app, so when I powered it on, setup was a snap. It actually talked to me from above my garage and kept me ...",,,,,,,,,,,,

368,"Priced right, and included a good selection. In original packaging.",,,,,,,,,,,,
369,This is a great product. Even the plumber that installed it commented on how well it was made. Home depot was great to work with!,,,,,,,,,,,,
370,Worked perfectly for the 3 cuts I needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
371,Comfortable and in excellent condition.,,,,,,,,,,,,
372,First time user of pex and these connectors. All worked great and everything is holding pressure and no leaks. Solid set of parts here!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
373,Works well for my needs. It's the right size for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,
374,Does the job. Used it on 1 inch ped. No burrs or rolled edges. Cut with minimal effort. Good price point.,,,,,,,,,,,,
375,No issues. Needed to fix 2 screens and was very easy to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
376,"The screen was easy to measure and trim to fit; however, the screen bowed after using the screen tool on the spline.  If purchasing again, I would allow for slack.",,,,,,,,,,,,
377,"This product is good overall but One of the most important functions of this product is to eliminate human waste. It does this BUT when flushing, the bowl water does not cover the entire surface of the bowl and does not wash away all solid residue which leaves waste on the bowl surface and forces me to wash it away!! I have used this for 2 months hoping bowl issues would change but they have not! The toilet flushes as normal and overall looks good but because of the void in bowl water coverage it does not meet my expectations!",,,,,,,,,,,,
378,"My wife likes that is lightweight and head can be changed to cover wide variety of areas (i.e. open lawn, against the flower beds, around the birdbath, etc.). Do wish it had instruction sheet or better picture on packaging, as there is one piece we can't figure out where it fits.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I can still sense it's presence, but miss being able to see and touch it",,,,,,,,,,,,
382,I love this nozzle! The thumb control is great and completely alleviates hand fatigue from having to keep a trigger type handle depressed.  The various nozzle shapes also offer a great variety so are easily changed to different watering needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,

384,This is a great product and very easy to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
385,"The transition from the green tub to the sprinkler head is much too weak.  When it is laying down, the slightest bump results in the metal tube breaking.  As long as you are careful, it works well. But, any torque at all at the top of the tube will break it.  My first was a wast of $18.  I have been careful with my 2nd one",,,,,,,,,,,,

392,Good price for this item,,,,,,,,,,,,
393,"Unit would clamp close but then wouldn't release on my very first use.  Remained stuck on my clamp on my PEX pipe.  Spring holding release lever sprang off, and the release lever wouldn't act.  Took a screwdriver to try to pry the release mechanism but to no avail.  Even removing screws holding the clamping handles didn't let it release.  Removed pins holding tool together and it still wouldn't release.  Eventually took enough gears out to let the tool release.  Now I have to take the pieces back to Home Depot for a return.Piece of junk.",,,,,,,,,,,,
394,"It's easy to hold, love all the different types of spray settings it has.",,,,,,,,,,,,
395,"We have the Lena smart toilet since Oct, 2020.  It is good looking, we felt for it, and we bought it.  But, it is just for the look now, we are not comfortable using it anymore. Every time we flush, it makes a loud 'Bang' sound.  We have been in contact with tech support from Ove, and per their suggestions, we have tried to reset the system, replace the solenoid.  We also tried difference connections: we first started with Ove shut-off value without water hammer arrester, then we installed the water hammer arrester, that didn't help, then we tried with the 3/8 shut-off valve connection.  But none of the above works.  (Please note: Ove didn't have any field technicians to help us to replace any parts or connect the toilet with difference methods.  All the works were done by a plumber, hired by us!)  Now, they are saying our water pipe need to strap down, well, that is easy, just knock a few walls and tight it down.  Even if we are willing to go that far, there is no guarantee that it will work.  We have disk washer machine, washer machine for cloth etc.â€¦ all work nicely and QUIETLY. So, I believe there is a defect in their design.  The 2 years warranty from Ove only go as far as sending us parts, we still need to pay someone to do the work, and there is limited number of parts they can send us, they won't give us a replacement or credit toward another product. so at the end of day, we got a $1200+ toilet sitting there for the look, and if we need some attention, we hit the flush button, and it will go 'bang', 'bang', 'bang'.",,,,,,,,,,,,
396,Looks great and comfortable but after sitting on the chair for a long period of time the shape doesn't bounce back unless I shape it manually.,,,,,,,,,,,,

398,"Bought this cutter for 1"" and 3/4"" PVC pipe.  Started on the 1"" first.  The first six (of 8) cuts went well, with the tool cutting as expected.  The blade actually chipped in several places, making it difficult to make the remaining two cuts.  It almost became impossible to perform two cuts on the 3/4"" pipe.  Returning product.  Would not buy again.",,,,,,,,,,,,

405,"Easy to install and use. Worked great at the beginning. 7 months into use, it started leaking. We used it to water plants daily, and uses the 'jet' setting to wash windows from outside sometimes. Ones it started leaking at the spray setting dial, it leaked at every setting like a open faucet. Didn't even last a while year!",,,,,,,,,,,,
406,Poor padding support.,,,,,,,,,,,,
407,Haven't had these long but I'm very impressed and they fit perfectly on my chairs. The gray tan color is so neutral I love them. I am using them on a screened in porch so they will hold up better than being outside.,,,,,,,,,,,,
408,"It's inexpensive and lightweight. I used it to cover the vents in my house so that bugs and particles do not get in. It was good for this purpose. If you want to use it for anything else, I suggest you get something more durable and heavy. This one is lite for lite projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,
409,Solid and sturdy ceiling fixture mount. Easy to install and will bear the weight some cheaper models won't.,,,,,,,,,,,,
410,"I would have given this sprinkler a five star review if the first one hadn't arrived damaged. Thankfully,customer service with Sun-Jo was really easy and they replaced it without any issues including prepaid shipping. The sprinkler is awesome!!See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
411,So far so good! Very easy to install. The cutter has two sides. Very convenient. Just be careful not to slice the material when you are ready to secure it down. Go slow when securing the rubber into the door.,,,,,,,,,,,,
412,It does feel like a cheap plastic but it gets the job done for the value. I'm a first time homeowner and doing lots of trial and errors with yard care and this works well for what I need.,,,,,,,,,,,,

417,Rarely jam but seem like they could be stronger.,,,,,,,,,,,,
418,Nice durable material. Made well. We store them when not in use. Comfortable both bottom and back.,,,,,,,,,,,,
419,"We bought these last year and they barely made it through the season. Lower pillows are squashed down and now very uncomfortable. They start off at 6"" but after a month they became more like 3"", and they sag in the middle. They're not cheap so we can't really replace them this year but if I could I would. The tan  color didn't fade, which is a plus, however the fabric does show grease marks so be careful when with sunblock or eating anything from the grill.",,,,,,,,,,,,
420,This tool crimped exactly 3 clamps before it crushed the last ratchet tooth and wouldn't automatically release. Not a total deal breaker but disappointing. Replacement ratchet teeth look worse. We will see.,,,,,,,,,,,,
421,Strong and sturdy for the price. does the job!,,,,,,,,,,,,
422,These screens are well made and easy to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,

425,Pretty good for the price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
426,"It was an easy install with no hiccups. The problem came with some white noise when trying to listen to some audio. I moved it from the corner that it was at thinking it was causing the issue but after it was moved to a more open and quiet location, I still heard white noise coming out of it. I had to return it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
427,"I received this item to evaluate and I was happy to accept it. I have always thought very highly of Rain Bird products and have used them for many years. They make the best sprinkler heads I've ever owned. That being said, I'm going to be a bit critical.This item is an in-ground sprinkler with a quick disconnect for your garden hose. It is designed to be mounted flush with the surface and uses an impulse sprinkler which can be adjusted for both distance and circumference. The sprinkler head itself measures about 4"" across at the cap in depth into the ground is 9"". The second part is a bit wider (5"") and mounts about 8 in. away from the sprinkler head itself. It's only 5"" tall but you will still have to dig down 9"" to make room for the hose adapter. The lid locks in place so you don't have to worry about it coming loose with from a lawnmower even a good one that has good vacuum power. The instructions state this can water up to 41 feet across in a full circle. This measurement depends on your water pressure and can vary by a few feet. Normal water pressure is generally between 40 and 60 PSI and my house runs at the higher end at 60-65 PSI this really covers a large area for me. As with any impulse style sprinkler head the distance can be adjusted at the front and the circumference can be adjusted anywhere from 0 to 360Â°. You will have to adjusted with the water on because this unit has a pretty beefy spring that holds a down. As you can see by one of the pictures, I'm using a bamboo stick to hold it in place so I can take a picture the sprinkler head and the stick is being bent from the spring tension. There is a lot of positive things to say about this model because it was built very well but I don't feel this would be of use for the average homeowner, unless they had a small yard or area needing watered. The reason I say this is because this is basically a sprinkler that you can never move around. It sprays in a circle, or half circle, or quarter circle (whatever you want) but it only does one area and wherever you bury it is where it stays. Plus, the colder northern areas where the ground freezes down a foot or more this thing could freeze as you blow it out like with a typical in-ground sprinkler system. That being said, this is one heavy duty sprinkler head and can easily be adapted to a regular sprinkler system as the input is threaded for generic adapters.So, I gave this four stars. Five stars for the Rain Bird quality that I've known for years and only three stars as this is not very practical for a typical homeowner as most homes do not have a just a single dedicated area for something like this. Since you still have to drag the hose out and put the adapter on, why not just get a regular impulse sprinkler that you can use everywhere in your yard?I will be adding this to my in-ground sprinkler system on its own zone since I have a large area of landscaping where this would work great. But if I had a choice of using one that would be permanently installed and I would have to hook a garden hose to every time, or just use a regular lawn sprinkler that I could use anywhere in my yard I would choose the latter. Rain Bird should sell these sprinkler heads separately because I really like these to use in an in-ground system.I would recommend it to a friend, but only if I knew they had an area where this would come in handy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
428,I used these to add lights between studs under rafters. Also used this for hanging ceiling fan. They adjust for a perfect fit.,,,,,,,,,,,,
429,"Pretty neat idea.  Once you get the distances dialed in, its a great sprinkler.  I spent about 30-40 minutes adjusting all the valves to the distances I needed and after that it worked great.  You'll need to re-adjust your distances if you move it around the yard but other than that, no issues with it.  Only down side, as others have mentioned, its really not 360 degrees, more like 340, but not a show stopper.",,,,,,,,,,,,
430,They are very durable work great are very useful a lot easier than using the old Twist and Turn method,,,,,,,,,,,,
431,Have used this product before. It is great quality and best of all it is made in America,,,,,,,,,,,,

433,"Product is exactly as described, easy to use, good quality, and great price.",,,,,,,,,,,,
434,"Works pretty well, a lot faster than ratchet type cutters.",,,,,,,,,,,,
435,I put it in the ground and the part that is brass on the bottom must have been damaged at the store or when shipped to the store and the whole thing broke off. Useless now and I didn't even get a chance to use it,,,,,,,,,,,,
436,Excellent clamp. Small but powerful.,,,,,,,,,,,,
437,"I like this nozzle it seems to be made of decent materials. It's pretty heavy duty and that makes me believe that it will hold up well. This nozzle creates a great seal, it twists with ease to allow the correct amount of water flow that you are wanting. I have no complaints with this nozzle. It should hold up for a few seasons if taken care of properly.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,

441,More than half the box jammed up wouldn't fire plastic collation was messed up nails couldnt be loaded into the nailer Slowed down the job drastically,,,,,,,,,,,,
442,"The cushions, seat and back, are very thin and offer minimum comfort.",,,,,,,,,,,,
443,"Excellent tools for the price. I have used the crimping tool on 1"", 3/4"" and 1/2"" pex clamps. The cutting tool is very sharp and even cut 1 1/4"" outdoor plastic pipe. The crimping tool will also work for automotive AN slip lock hose clamps.",,,,,,,,,,,,
444,"Haven't use it yet but, it seems to be good handeling it's built of good material and seems tough",,,,,,,,,,,,
445,Nice Cutter for PEX. Sharp and Clean Cutting. Only issue is wish they were made in USA.,,,,,,,,,,,,
446,This is the best option when replacing a box that was mounted on the side of a rafter and a box with adjustable brackets won't work. Mounts securely.,,,,,,,,,,,,
447,This worked great for putting in a ceiling fan under 35 lbs.  Cut the hole and put it in.  Easy to role the bar too.,,,,,,,,,,,,
448,This camera is super high-quality definition and has a good range of view. We absolutely love it and it works great with the rest of the Google Home suite of products.,,,,,,,,,,,,
449,Love it! Works great and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
450,"From watering plants to washing cars this will save your back. The flexible head can be adjusted to many positions as can the multi function head. I like the telescoping part best. I was so curious as to how it would work I washed my car on a winter day, it works fine. I suggest you use some caution and treat it kindly as it has many plastic parts. But all in all I think it's a great item.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
451,"This is a great design but it would not work with the housing my electrician used. They glued their housing into the pipe in the floor so we could not take their housing out. I love the recessed box so the lid can be closed with items still plugged in . The lid was plastic, not metal, but seemed pretty sturdy. I would have bought it again if I had worked with the electrician beforehand. As I bought it was before the house was finished, I did not ask to return it. It is just sitting in our storage unit.",,,,,,,,,,,,
452,Good value. I have several of these cameras. They do a good job and the images are fairly sharp. I would by them again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
453,"These are my go to clamps, I have 2 sets. They hold firm, have rubber feet and are easy to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
454,"Excellent value, works as advertised.",,,,,,,,,,,,
455,"Very useful for applying uniform pressure to small items (2-3-inches wide).  Used three to glue together a split table leg that was 2.5-inches wide.  Very simple to use, however, be careful in applying too much pressure while tightening the clamps -- the plastic parts could break.",,,,,,,,,,,,
456,It adjusts to different sprays but not directly. I get a wide spray two times before a power spray. Other than knowing that it works well. Could be a bit longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,
457,"Although being all plastic, this unit is surprisingly stable. It has a very accommodating pattern adjustment. Our 30' x 50' garden is about at its limits, but one has to take into account our 50psi well pump, and the 150' hose supplying it. This is the best oscillating sprinkler I've ever owned. I am curious how it will hold up to the UV of the hot Texas sun.",,,,,,,,,,,,
458,The camera works very well got it in December & use it for my son & I can see perfectly with it definitely worth the 25 bucks !!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
459,"heavy box, feel bad for the delivery guy. Product is great. Had one jam occur in the nailer with these, which was easily remedied. The plastic connector point broke, but it was a very cold & muddy day. Overall, they make a great strong connection. Will purchase these again",,,,,,,,,,,,
460,"Great quality, the seat is higher. I love it. I'm 6'-7""",,,,,,,,,,,,
461,"I have a large screened in porch. My first experience with this product.Every roll I purchased , once in place produced a nasty glare whenever sun was shining on it. One roll was dented throughout the entire roll . I returned all rolls. Home Depot was great and Phifer was interested in the pics I sent them. Would NOT recommend this product.",,,,,,,,,,,,
462,"After installing this toilet, we discovered that the chain for the lever to lift the AquaPiston is broken. Won't cost much to fix, but really disappointing and now we have to fix the toilet.",,,,,,,,,,,,
463,Very impressed with this camera for the price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
464,"Worked well with my other rings and Alexa show. You will need a waterproof 4"" round box if you don't have one.",,,,,,,,,,,,
465,Excellent tool. It was very easy to use. It even has a light that comes on when the clamp is fully pinched.  The tool is good for multiple size pinch clamps.,,,,,,,,,,,,
466,Cuts through pvc pipe like butter,,,,,,,,,,,,
467,"Good value. I did 5 screen windows and they look great, especially from the outside. My old ones were starting to turn white and one had a hole in it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
468,"They are absolutely beautiful, however they were to small for my chairs and I had to return.",,,,,,,,,,,,
469,Good quality and easy to install. Definitely recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
470,"I purchased this product around the first week of June 2021. So fa so good. It's easy to shut off the water, has good jet stream option when you lose the nozzle.",,,,,,,,,,,,
471,"Good fit, great price. A little difficult to open/close one handed, but that's probably for the best!",,,,,,,,,,,,
472,"Worked for an hour then quit oscillating forever, guess you get what you pay for !!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
473,So easy to cut off a garden hose end to add a new male tip. Truth is I really just wanted this ratcheting cutter but I have any other hoses or pipes to cut. Nice looking tool...,,,,,,,,,,,,
474,This cushions are for show only once you sit on them they become flat as a pancake. Expecting much more from Home Depot. Come on where is the quality that you pride yourself with. These are the kinds of cushions that you can expect to find at Big lot! Home Depot is not the place to go for quality anymore! So sad.,,,,,,,,,,,,
475,Installed easily and works as expected.  Not a huge fan of the plastic seat.,,,,,,,,,,,,
476,Not a jam to be had. These performed excellent in both of my style guns.  I have 2 air powered ones and a battery powered one. .,,,,,,,,,,,,
477,Love the convenience of the thumb control fo flow rate. Well constructed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
478,I bought this pipe cutter in 2019. I used it once. Now in 2021 I had to use it for a second time. After cutting a second pipe I noticed a piece of the blade had chipped off. Save your money and buy a better brand.,,,,,,,,,,,,
479,Exactly what I needed and does itâ€™s job for a great price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
480,The screen was very easy to install I am very pleased. The new screen looks very nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,

482,"The quick release works great and making it's use much quicker, I have over 48 years of experience working with tools for a living, I would definitely purchase it again",,,,,,,,,,,,
483,"Great colors, Great length and thickness and style as well as texture",,,,,,,,,,,,
484,Super easy to install,,,,,,,,,,,,
485,shiny and new.  The issue is the nail strip broke in half too easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,
486,"Excellent resistance of damage from dog paws. While slightly thicker, everyone I've installed it for very much likes it's additional strength.",,,,,,,,,,,,
487,Works good. No issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,
488,These cameras are fantastic I have five of them in one location four in another everything I could ask for ! the bad reviews on here are all due to poor wireless Internet if you got a poor wireless Internet signal of 3 MB or less then don't expect to get good quality video on demand it's not gonna happen. Anything above that 3mb excellent video quality and excellent access to stored videos through their servers.,,,,,,,,,,,,
489,"Longtime TP-Link consumer here, and glad they were open to making security wifi cameras.Very easy to set up and use. Pretty much and a plug and play camera.I use this for my door entrance when I am away, but I also have friends who use this for their pets LOLOne thing I also recommend for anyone with smart/wifi devices is that you make a separate wifi ID for your tech.All in all, this is a nice little camera with big quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,
490,"Colors are more vivid than on my screen. The pinks are more coral, big flowers coral/orange. They are quite pretty. I've put two of them on old chairs that now look new and vibrant. Didn't see any of the problems other reviewers noted. No stitching issues. Ties are matching and long enough. Back is even a bit higher than the chair. Getting them on sale was a sweet bonus.",,,,,,,,,,,,
491,Very user friendly item. Was compatible and easy to use with my tool.,,,,,,,,,,,,
492,Easy to use. The movement and action is smooth. It is easy to adjust to the desired watering patterns. It is also easy to clean if there is small impurities that got into your hose.,,,,,,,,,,,,
493,Paid a little more than the cheap plastic ones I usually buy  but right away I knew this was a lot tougher,,,,,,,,,,,,
494,Worked well for it's purpose,,,,,,,,,,,,
495,I really wanted to live these!  However I am really disappointed the cushion is poor quality!  I am packing them up to get refund and buy something else.  This is after using Saturday evening and this morning- you can tell the seat cushions are permanently squished and I am not a large person- very disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
496,"I actually returned a different brand for the Hampton Bay. These were more expensive and a much nicer Nave Blue. They are not holding up and proving to be as durable as expected after only 1 month they don't ""rebound"" after sitting on them. They flatten out and stay that way...I absolutely did not expect this...I previously had H.Bay seating that held up for a couple of years.Not Happy with these...Sorry...",,,,,,,,,,,,
497,"I don't know if it was broken when I got it or if it broke when I attached the hose. Which ever, I used it once and the threaded hose connector is completely split.",,,,,,,,,,,,
498,I love it and the quality is great and the night vision is awesome and I would recommend it highly,,,,,,,,,,,,
499,"Unfortunately, I had to return them because the did not fit,",,,,,,,,,,,,
500,Easy to install. If tool is pushed to hard during installation it will cut through the screen. The rubber rope is to small for average screens. It did stop bugs from coming into the house.,,,,,,,,,,,,
501,"I have purchased these on numerous occasion (dozens of boxes). I have received them in good shape they hold boards tightly. Perhaps users ""holding"" issues are related to low quality sub flooring. I install over 3/4"" plywood covered with new 1/4"" Luan underpayment. Underlayment is secured with underlayment (ring) nails.",,,,,,,,,,,,
502,"Out of all of the pipe cutters I use, this kobalt PEX cutter is the easiest tool I use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
503,"I live in the country where we don't have street lights. I mounted this camera in the backyard and it's amazing how well we can see at night. We can count how many vehicle drive on our gravel road, we can even see our next door neighbors (quarter mile away) cows in his fields. Man that sounds hick ha ha. We really feel safer now that we can see anyone who plans to come or go through the back.",,,,,,,,,,,,
504,"I have a long flower garden in my front yard that I will be replanting soon. The output is just the right length and the water flow is steady. It does cover a lot of area, however, I am not totally sure about the 2600 aq ft. It's inexpensive plastic, but seems sturdy enough and like it will last a couple years. Came with no wasteful packaging; just pull the tag off, attach hose, and turn to your desired setting.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
505,"It wasn't difficult to install the box in hardwood floor, but the template opening is a little too small.  You may have to shave a bit to get it to fit.  Don't know if it a child-proof issue or not, but the cover is very hard to open without a screw-driver to pry it open. Shouldn't be an issue if the plugs are not changed frequently.  I wouldn't recommend for carpet because even at lowest adjustment, it still sticks up a bit and might be a trip hazard on carpet.",,,,,,,,,,,,
506,The toilet tank lid did not fit cleanly and the ceramic glaze was incomplete. You can see uncoated ceramic. I am disappointed with Kohler's quality control.,,,,,,,,,,,,
507,"Great little kit. I measured my windows before ordering so I estimated how much I could get done. Good quality screen, the little spline tool is slightly flimsy but gets the job done! Worst case, you could buy a nicer spline tool if you were going to do a lot of new screens, but the included one works just fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,
508,I love the various settings that can be used with this water wand. The level of water dispersed can be adjusted as needed and this suits my needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
509,"Exactly as advertised, worked as should in gun, will purchase again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
510,"Nice toilet, easy install, but when researching for a ""quiet"" toilet, this was the one recommended. While I don't regret the purchase, it's in fact no quieter than other Kohler, or any other toilet.",,,,,,,,,,,,
511,"For the first time, I can adjust a sprinkler to exactly where I need it to sprinkle.  Easy to adjust, and I don't get drenched!",,,,,,,,,,,,
512,"The installation was extremely simple. The hardest part of the installation process and has nothing to do with this product is the part where you remove your screen door. Once you have the screen door removed, the installation of the new screen with the tool and material provided was extremely straight forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,
513,"These were needed to mount new pair of heavier light fixtures. I actually bought these to save a few dollars versus the screw bar type you maneuver into an existing hole that cost more, but granted with these you have to have access to the exposed joist like I did in the attic. They're definitely as strong as the other types if not stronger due to the ability to nail or (in my case) screw into the wood.",,,,,,,,,,,,
514,"Works very good, good buy !!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
515,Reworked and electrical plug. Perfect fit where I put it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
516,"I have old 1920s metal frame windows that don't accommodate any type of screen. I used this screen material with stick-on heavy duty magnet tape to create custom size window screens. It worked great, the screen is barely visible once you put it up, durable, and effective.",,,,,,,,,,,,
517,Perfect easy to use tool for cutting PVC for my needs,,,,,,,,,,,,
518,I like the the ribbed shanks... they hold much better. I recommend these nails.,,,,,,,,,,,,
519,"Looks good easy to install, and adhesion could be good. On the other hand, the person who sent the tape. Cut and tape the end. The plastic coverage and paper wasn't there. I bought something new and, I received something used. I returned the item.",,,,,,,,,,,,
520,"I was very happy to find this tool at a reasonable price. I had been using saws and was not happy with the finished cut. This tool cuts PEX easily and cleanly. I only gave it a 4 star as the cots do not always look square. However, they worked fine with the Quick Connect fittings.",,,,,,,,,,,,
521,"The specifications said a maximum 2"" jaw opening. The maximum jaw opening is 1.25 inches.Complete waste of money.",,,,,,,,,,,,
522,"At first excited to get a good deal, but boy was I dissatisfied. Box looked like the picture, but most coils were in perfect condition. As for functionality, they were terrible, the wire that keeps them coiled failed to detach properly. Constantly, causing nailer to jam & wire to bunch up around the head of the fastener. Haven't seen that in yrs, so I would hope to chalk it up to bad batch. Though to sell a under par product and not have disclaimer is in my opinion ""Rude""...",,,,,,,,,,,,
523,"I would recommend this product for ease of installation. There seem to be connectivity issues at times.Unless you pay for the upgrade the camera only records 12 seconds then passes for 5 minutes. It does not start recording until objects are within 10 feet of the camera,  disappointing people can get almost to the door and turn around before camera starts video.",,,,,,,,,,,,
524,Came with clamps and cutter for a good price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
525,We purchased two of these at the recommendation of the sales person. We installed one and it would not flush. Installed the other one and it works fine. We worried that maybe it was our plumbing and called in a plumber but he said it wasn't the plumbing but something with the toilet. We called American Standard and got a few tips but nothing worked. We now have to drive to return the defective one. It has been very frustrating and disappointing. We will replace it with a different product entirely.,,,,,,,,,,,,
526,Aqua Joe sprinkler is very well made and did a great job but for my yard which is almost an acre the watered area was too small. I did return them .,,,,,,,,,,,,
527,This is a horrid camera. Motion sensor does not work. It triggers for dust and bugs but not cars and humans. Any ambient light completely washes out the night vision.,,,,,,,,,,,,
528,Screen does NOT come in a roll as show in the Amazon photos making it harder to press flat when installing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
529,"Easy to install, clean lines and nice to look at.",,,,,,,,,,,,
530,I like the numerous ways the spray can be adjusted.,,,,,,,,,,,,
531,Easy to use and practically invisible when looking through windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,
532,Product of good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,
533,"replaced old and damaged screen. well packed upon arrival. Very clear to see through,almost like it is not there.",,,,,,,,,,,,
534,The cushions fit the chairs & are comfortable. I love the colors & pattern. Our warm weather is just getting started & haven't had the cushions out very much. I don't usually leave my cushions out and get great wear because of that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
535,This is a well made nozzle it is well constructed. It is easy to put it on your hoses at your house or any where you need it. You can adjust the stream of the water that comes out. It doesn't have a lot of selections of stream of water but you can use it on any thing. This nozzle is very handy. I really love this product.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
536,"Now I can leave the door open, get some fresh air without disturbing the view and keep the bugs and bees out! Excellent Quality!",,,,,,,,,,,,
537,"This 8 pattern nozzle is a really good addition to your lawn and gardening watering.  It has  8 excellent and diverse patterns to use according to what you are watering or cleaning.  I used this same model of nozzle for the past two seasons and now it leaks ( drips on low pressure) after 3 years.  For the reasonable price, and the fact that it isn't made of cheap plastic, 2 years of delivering good service is acceptable to me.  Don't drop the nozzle on hard surfaces, like driveways, rather set it down, and it will continue to perform for you.  I'm buying  a second nozzle this year for my backyard watering and cleaning.  If it lasted longer, it would deserve 5 stars!",,,,,,,,,,,,
538,"I purchased elbows, tees, PEX barb pinch clamps, and a 1-hand PEX clamp tool (all items are Apollo). Everything arrived quickly and is just as shown on The Home Depot website.  The tool was easy to use and I was able to use it with one hand in very tight quarters.  It worked well and seems well made.  One hand operation may be difficult to start if you have small hands.",,,,,,,,,,,,
539,It is a good product. Easy to work with. Only problem I had is that there seems to be a lot of waste in using this product. My window is a normal size but I would think they would size the roll to reflect a general window size.,,,,,,,,,,,,
540,Well made and works as advertised.  NOT a cheap plastic nozzel!,,,,,,,,,,,,
541,Works great used to repair broken dining table leg,,,,,,,,,,,,
542,"They shoot, they stick, they hold.",,,,,,,,,,,,
543,"It fit the window perfectly. Since I have an old house, I needed an adjustable screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,
544,"I love the vibrant colors, very tropical.  They have been out in the rain and the sun and are still just like new.",,,,,,,,,,,,
545,We purchased this camera to use near a dog cage.  It does the job very well.  It can give a static picture or a video with audio.  We had some issues with the installation but we're able to resolve it ourselves.  A good camera for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
546,"These Are the best! After I got the app set up, now I can see everything going on in my neighborhood around my house. The resolution is great. You can adjust sensitivity and brightness. The batteries last for months. Definitely going to buy more once I get my shop built.",,,,,,,,,,,,
547,It may be the best sprinkler ever.  Super easy to control where the water goes and where it does not!,,,,,,,,,,,,
548,This is a smaller sprinkler. Light in weight and seems like a cheaper model. Hose attacheswell and it oscillates back and forth with no issues so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,
549,Very nice shape with easy to clean lines.  The porcelain edges are unfinished on the lid and I will CallKohler for replacement lids for both toilets as others have done judging from ratings.Considering that my last gorgeous toile cost 900.00 plus  and this one is about a third of the costit is a good find. Seeps to flush well.  It is a great replacement for one we lost in the Camp Fire.The unglazed part is a distraction but I am ok with that for the time being. I can not stand two piece toilets.,,,,,,,,,,,,
550,Pattern is even prettier in person.,,,,,,,,,,,,
551,"one of the pair works ok, but the other is completely useless, cant think of many jobs that need 1 bar clamp but that's all that would work, the other wouldn't even tighten up without walking down the bar, tried all kinds of suggestions and tricks, big disappointment.",,,,,,,,,,,,
552,"No jams, works great and priced reasonably.",,,,,,,,,,,,
553,"This Apollo 1/2 in. to 1 in. Pipe Cutter works as described.  It feels comfortable to grip and with minimal pressure you can feel the cutter, cutting through the apex Pipe.  The cuts are straight and the edges are smooth.  It also feels it will last a long time.  Good tool to have for the professionals or for the average homeowner.",,,,,,,,,,,,
554,EASY INSTALLATION. VERY GOOD PRODUCT. IT HAS EVERYTHING FOR THE MODERN LIFE.,,,,,,,,,,,,
555,Great price and great quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,
556,This is extremely easy to use and covers wide area. Made my life so easy for watering outdoor grass :),,,,,,,,,,,,
557,I used the electrical box to replace one of the same in my landscape lights.   Worked great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
558,"I have needed to replace a worn seat pad in my guest chair on my sun porch for a while.  This seat pad was exactly what I was looking for.  First, the color is fantastic, it's cheerful and adds that pop of color that the porch needed.  Second, the fabric texture was just right, not too smooth, but not rough at all.  Third, the welting and cushioning makes me feel that this seat pad will be durable and can sustain the daily visits from my neighbor and their cup of coffee!The cushion is very comfortable to sit on and the ties in the back help keep it in place.  I would recommend this cushion to anyone looking to give some color and comfort to their chairs, it seems durable and because of the way it's designed and constructed, I expect it to last a long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
559,"Great clamps. Great price. You can never have enough clamps, so I jumped on these when on sale during Cyber Monday deal. Not disappointed. Wish I had a few more.....",,,,,,,,,,,,
560,Cushions fit my chairs perfectly. I liked the choice of colors available.,,,,,,,,,,,,
561,Easy to use. Go / no go gage ensures proper crimp has been made.,,,,,,,,,,,,
562,Not a true 24x24 so it left significant gaps on my sofa that my previous cushions covered also the pillow cushion backs are hard and overstuffed to the uncomfortable point. For the very high price I expected these to be comfortable and fit well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
563,I ordered collated round head hot dipped galvanized smooth shank nails. I received full round head plastic smooth shank nails. This is exactly WRONG. Useless for the current project.,,,,,,,,,,,,
564,Product works perfectly. Good value,,,,,,,,,,,,
565,"The toilet works fine once you find one without manufacturing defects.  There is a small hole at the front of the bowl.  The first one we got and installed shot water out of this hole and onto the wall.  Contacted Kohler and they arranged for a replacement.  Second one works fine.  If you read other reviews online, you will find others have experienced this same issue.  Evidently a quality control step is missing in the manufacturing process.",,,,,,,,,,,,
566,"project pack has an assortment of nail sizes, ideal if you only need a few nails of a particular size...",,,,,,,,,,,,
567,"worked great with my Milwakee 15ga. nailer. No issues with penetration or setting. During first initial use, I used approx. 150 cnt with no bending or binding issues. I will continue to use these nails for the next project. Also add I was using a soft wood product in my project.",,,,,,,,,,,,
568,"These are beautiful and really upgraded out patio chairs, just love the construction and will have for many years.",,,,,,,,,,,,
569,"While the price seems high, you are getting a pair of spots with motion detector that also has a Ring camera hooked up to it. The design made installation a snap - a very pleasant surprise. The Ring camera added to our existing systems in just a few clicks on the phone. The camera quality is very good in daylight and when lights are on at night and amazingly good in the dark without lights. We have been able to spot our backyard coyotes on a regular basis.",,,,,,,,,,,,
570,After sitting in the cushions for 3 hours they deflated and never returned to original condition,,,,,,,,,,,,
571,Easy to set up.  Nice alerts and would recommend it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
572,"I like the 3 different size nails that I could try out,",,,,,,,,,,,,
573,I use everyday with my nailer never have a problem with this brad nail,,,,,,,,,,,,
574,For the price and for monitoring Nest is great. I am considering adding more to Google home . Amazed by the sound quality,,,,,,,,,,,,
575,Great power but it does not have a trigger to turn the water off. You have to walk all the way back to the water spigot to turn it off. Bit inconvenient.,,,,,,,,,,,,
576,Great product. Instructions and tools worked fantastic. Will purchase again for future fixes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
577,I have used these nails for years and never a problem with jamming or sticking. Good hold and set.,,,,,,,,,,,,
578,Very good cushions and good price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
579,The tool was easy to set up and the spray reach is great. I like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
580,"I originally went in to buy a pressure washing wand for my garden hose since my gas pressure washer wasnt working. I needed to clean my house' siding and didnt wanna spend too much on another gas pressure washer so I ended up buying this and a pressure washing wand to compare them, THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER. I returned the wand and promptly cleaned my entire house and garage with it, totally worth the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,
581,This camera works great! Very happy with our purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,
582,Just as described and great value!,,,,,,,,,,,,
583,The only sprinkler I'll ever buy! LOVE the range & works awesome!,,,,,,,,,,,,
584,The screen started splitting when we tried to smooth out the creases while installing cord. Super thin and cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,
585,"Everything, including the installation tool, for less than the cost of a small roll in store and elsewhere. Perfectly satisfactory quality too.",,,,,,,,,,,,
586,"It cuts through the pipe fairly easily, however I found that sometimes it was difficult to keep a straight cut. So as I would cut around the pipe it would offset the cut making a small bur on one side of the cut.",,,,,,,,,,,,
587,"quick shipping of course, packaged good,web site was also good.",,,,,,,,,,,,
588,Easy to instal. Better comfort than traditional toilets especially for someone with arthritis,,,,,,,,,,,,
589,Exactly what I was looking for sturdy and good,,,,,,,,,,,,
590,Very comfortable!,,,,,,,,,,,,
591,Not satisfied because didn't come with extended part so I just left in my garage. Because hard to return in pandemic and only ten dollars.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
592,Great value with great quality,,,,,,,,,,,,
593,It was ok it bent easy,,,,,,,,,,,,
594,Worked well for the application.,,,,,,,,,,,,
595,The nails fit my nail gun perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
596,"Does the job the first time. Very easy to install. I had my daughter hold a hard object (clipboard) on one side so I had something to press on. Quick, easy, done!",,,,,,,,,,,,
597,Fit nice in my customers chairs. She is happy,,,,,,,,,,,,
598,"Easy to use, very good design, feels sturdy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
599,"I waited to review after having it for over a month.  I had someone install it and they said it was easy enough and was impressed with Delta.  They were used to installing American Standard.Flushes well every time, no leaks.    A little louder than prior toilet, but doesn't last long.",,,,,,,,,,,,
600,"I ordered two boxes of brad nails to start they were 4 days late getting here , and when i opened the box it was like someone just threw them in there broken in pieces 1 inch and 1 1/4 all mixed up neither size were in their box it was a mess was not what i expecited",,,,,,,,,,,,
601,A friend of mine is a plumber and he saw me using a saw to cut pipe. He showed me this tool and what a difference this tool makes. Cuts PVC like butter. Well worth the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
602,Bought 4 of these to help me with my picnic table project. Came in very handy.. unfortunately I now have orders to make more tables...,,,,,,,,,,,,
603,Nails constantly misfeed causing the gun to not allow the nose to fully depress.,,,,,,,,,,,,
604,"Came from the factory without a washer on the Water Control Fill Valve.  Shortly after turning on the water I noticed it leaking.  Checked to see the Fill Valve nut was tight...still leaking.  Looking in the tank there didn't appear to be a rubber washer on the Fill Valve.  I had another toilet so I checked that out and it had a grey washer.  Took it apart the new one and confirmed.  Ran out to the garbage to get the washer off the old toilet before trash was picked up or I'd be without a toilet.  I've been on the phone for for an hour and a half for them to send me a washer and I am still waiting in the queue.  A $250 toilet should have better QA then for someone to miss installing a 50 cent rubber washer at the factory.  I assume it wasn't even tested there or they would have seen it leaking as soon as water was filled in the tank.  I've now spent longer on the phone than it took for me to remove the old toilet, put the new one in, grab a part from the old toilet, disassemble the new toilet and put temporary old washer so I have a toilet waiting for them (I assume) to send me a washer.  Their phone keeps saying they appreciate my time is important  but if that was the case I wouldn't be sitting on the phone for this long.",,,,,,,,,,,,
605,"Great product. Has held up to cat, two dogs and 3 children with minimal damage in 2 years. Previously were replacing screen more than once a year.",,,,,,,,,,,,
606,Very useful and good price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
607,Easy to assemble.  Nice finish.    It was a little difficult to adjust to the way the water dumps.   You have to hold the handle down to get a full tank flush.    This does allow you to do a #1 small flush that saves water.   Bowl is clean either way which is comforting.,,,,,,,,,,,,
608,Nails worked good in new F21. Will purchase again if I cant find anything a little cheaper. Hard to find 21 deg. metal connector nails plastic colated.,,,,,,,,,,,,
609,"Works fine in my old nail gun, had trouble with some nails jamming.",,,,,,,,,,,,
610,These cushions are completely collapsing after the first few days of use. Very unhappy with the lack of quality.  The color was exactly what I expected bit I don't expect they will last a month.,,,,,,,,,,,,
611,Lightweight super handy,,,,,,,,,,,,
612,Nozzle works well for various needs in the flower beds/ yard.,,,,,,,,,,,,
613,Good for old work additional electric. Plenty deep for thru plaster applications.,,,,,,,,,,,,
614,"Great price! Fits my Craftsman finish gun! Plastic container is good idea, where cardboard can get wet!",,,,,,,,,,,,
615,Works great so you better go get one before they discontinue it! Keep it on the shelf forever please!,,,,,,,,,,,,
616,Great price. Easy to operate. Perfect for our small yard.,,,,,,,,,,,,
617,Just an overall bad design. Low water level causes sticking (poo). Flush doesn't cover all surfaces of the bowl. Poor design has turbulent flow which causes the poo to have some backwash back into the bowl after a flush. Have to flush 2 or 3 times after you go poo. Do not buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
618,Very easy to assemble and easy set up on phone,,,,,,,,,,,,
619,Lovely and thick. Can't wait for patio season,,,,,,,,,,,,
620,This ratcheting pipe cutter cuts PVC pipe so much easier than the last one I bought! So glad I found it!,,,,,,,,,,,,
621,"Somewhat expensive, this is a good sturdy sprinkler. However, too much for made in taiwan!",,,,,,,,,,,,
622,"Dewalt 16 ga brad nails ,,, great product for the money, and fast delivery next day wow ,,, ty! I recommend this product!",,,,,,,,,,,,
623,"Super easy to cut to size, install and super durable! I crawled and walked all over this, my kids have been hitting the screen and no issues at all!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
624,I wanted to love this sprayer but immediately after getting it on the hose it started leaking water. I tried adjusting it several times but anytime I use it I end up soaked .,,,,,,,,,,,,
625,Outstanding tool at the best price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
626,"I bought this to re-screen a patio door for my daughter. She thought she would have to buy a whole new door! With the video instructions, and making some adjustments for what seemed to work better for me, it turned out beautifully. Like another reviewing, slow and steady is the way to go. I set the spline slowly the first go around with the concave wheel on the tool, and then rolled again with the convex side, being sure it was forced in the groove. I was worried about a slack screen and wavy installation but it's almost self-tightening with the spline. Very satisfying project, and a great price!",,,,,,,,,,,,
627,Very disappointed they were cheap and they looked cheap I should have sent them back but it was not worth the trouble.,,,,,,,,,,,,
628,great for the money,,,,,,,,,,,,
629,"My vinyl wicker patio set seats 6, so I was glad that the cushion set came in sets of 2; my problem is that the seat of the chairs measures 21"" x 22"". Nowhere can I find that oddly sized cushion (19"" x 19"" is standard & the depth is skimpy), so I took a chance on this set. I was able to get the width to fit the chairs OK, but the cushion's seat extends beyond the chair edge - it wasn't too bad to adjust to this feature. The depth is super plush and comfortable! Because the chairs' back is rounded the pillows are fine. We recently had a driving rain & the material made the water start to bead up; I pulled the chairs affected by the rain deeper into the lanai's protected area and wiped the cushions dry. Personally, I wouldn't risk leaving them out like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,
630,Pretty sturdy clamps for $3. Very surprised at quality. Works better than grip clamps which broke in my hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,
631,I love this thing.  So much easier than squeezing a trigger,,,,,,,,,,,,
632,Fixed up a few old screens a cat had tore up and this was perfect for the job. It's also thick and sturdy,,,,,,,,,,,,
633,This is not the most user friendly item. Need to spin to cut and very difficult to make a clean straight cut.,,,,,,,,,,,,
634,"Efficient, excellent quality, easy to install",,,,,,,,,,,,
635,The end pads keep coming off but good and strong!,,,,,,,,,,,,
636,Exactly as described. Great product would highly recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
637,This is a low quality product,,,,,,,,,,,,
638,Worked like a charm on and old piece of pvc.Ask me how it is next year!,,,,,,,,,,,,
639,"This Ring Camera works well, and is easy to stop and install. I wish the power cords was detachable",,,,,,,,,,,,
640,This kit was easy to use and came with everything I needed to replace my sliding glass door screen. Great price & I had leftover screen!,,,,,,,,,,,,
641,Very sharp. Cuts with ease and strait....,,,,,,,,,,,,
642,easy to use I saved alot of money doing my own pluming.,,,,,,,,,,,,
643,Screen replacements look nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,
644,held off on purchase thought it was too expensive but this is the best sprinkler I have ever had covers amazing width and length and is a breeze to adjust and use great product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
645,Easy to load and use. Grabs material well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
646,I received this sprinkler but did not receive the adapter. I am very disappointed because I can't use this item. I don't think that I should have to buy an adapter because it was supposed to be included.,,,,,,,,,,,,
647,"Despite both the website and the internal computer system's insistence, this item does not exist anywhere in Seattle.  They still took my money for it, though.Things I learned:1) never use Lowe's pick-up service.  I went by the store 3 hours after ordering and they hadn't even looked at the ticket.2) don't trust Lowe's inventory system, ever.3) there is nothing funnier than a Lowe's employee staring, motionless, for 5 minutes, at the exact same rack location that you yourself have confirmed does *not* contain your items - when it took you 10 seconds to make the same assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,,
648,These nails where just what we needed but arrived opened and the sticks where all broken up so they where hard to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
649,"Absolutely delighted with fit, material and comfort of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,
650,"Updated my bathroom from the 80's.  Definitely notice more power, less water and no where near as loud when flushing.  I did upgrade the seat to a bidet addon.",,,,,,,,,,,,
651,Looks good after install,,,,,,,,,,,,
652,Great price. great product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
653,I've used these nails framing a basement and have ran about 500 of them so far. I'm using the Paslode framing nailer and these nails seem to sink well and hold tight. Zero complaints.,,,,,,,,,,,,
654,"If you are replacing old screens or bent/discolored frame pieces, this frame kit is perfect. You will not save money buying bulk from online sources, because you buy as much as you need the first time and get more if you need more. Easy to cut and super easy to assemble. I'll always get these kits from Home Depot from now on.",,,,,,,,,,,,
655,"I bought this camera and an indoor mini camera as add-ons to an existing system I purchased last year. I was certainly surprised to learn that these new cameras would require a storage plan. I'm not interested in any type of off-site storage. The original 2 cameras with the sync module work wonderfully without this. I just wanted to add more cameras. The new cameras let me view, but won't record without a storage plan. I feel like I got played.",,,,,,,,,,,,
656,Was really easy to install. My intall with this product was more stable than the one that was built with the house.,,,,,,,,,,,,
657,Nails worked great in my Porter Cable 21 degree framing nailer.  One cartridge of nails did have a longer nail in the group but otherwise everything was good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
658,"This is the best sprinkler I've ever had, It's easy to control and it doesn't leak",,,,,,,,,,,,
659,I used it to cut through 1/4 and 3/8 high pressure tubing. It was very sharp and worked great,,,,,,,,,,,,
660,"Typical sprinkler, unfortunately gears are plastic, so will likely need replaced every couple years (this was a replacement for my last one that also had plastic gearing). It works as expected and sprays quite high.",,,,,,,,,,,,
661,Fed just fine in a new Craftsman framing nailer. No jams or other issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,
662,Very good quality.  Love the fact that it is a higher toilet.,,,,,,,,,,,,
663,"Far too much flex when tightened down to be anything more than a lightweight clamp, no better than the plastic ones. I do understand the deep throat on this vice will tend to flex a little more than the shallow models. But this unit could use a much heavier consyruction to minimize this.",,,,,,,,,,,,
664,"made nice and works but I was hoping for something more powerful-to clean off brick/siding on garage and porch steps- it is just OK but not any stronger' than the attachment that came with my new garden hose itself. (which is AWESOME also from WalMart 75ft Upgraded Expandable Garden Hose Set, Extra Strength Fabric Triple Layer Latex Core, 3/4"" Solid Brass Fittings, 10 Function Spray Nozzle with Storage Bag) so I will return this nozzle and get something more powerful-See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
665,Haven't had any jam or get stuck.,,,,,,,,,,,,
666,"I bought a farm house and the pex install was atrocious and haphazardly done. Bought this tool to allow me to rework the existing pex and clean up the install. No issues with the crimps, tool was easy to use and perfect crimps were / are easily achieved. The included tool to cut old bands off worked perfectly with a bit of practice, allowed me to reuse many pieces of the existing exact length pex.",,,,,,,,,,,,
667,Fits Ryobi well and do not misfire.,,,,,,,,,,,,
668,Sharp blade and easy to use on pex pipes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
669,"Easy to use, but the spring popped out once. Over all likes the product.",,,,,,,,,,,,
670,this product worked a few hours then started to leak on the shaft and stopped working,,,,,,,,,,,,
671,"A very good deal from some strong clamps, the highest of quality and performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,
672,"These mini clamps are about the size of a medium office binder clip. Perfect for those small craft projects you need to clamp. Both ends have been dipped in a rubber coating. They clamp down hard all the while being easy to open. I can envision many other uses for them too i.e. taking place of clothes pins, and keeping tablecloths on picnic tables.",,,,,,,,,,,,
673,"Thick steel and high quality coating. The amount and size options for KOs is terrific as well. Only complaint was hole for ground screw was fouled by coating.  I'd like to see the next gen have mount options for sides to mount it flush to bottom of a joist, facing downward",,,,,,,,,,,,
674,"Cheaply made and leaks like a fountain.  I like the features like the thumb pressure adjustment, but it just keeps leaking.",,,,,,,,,,,,
675,Arrived on time and well packaged. Screwed onto the end of the hose easily. Even came with extra rubber washers. It doesn't leak and has many different spray patterns which is nice. Best spray nozzle I have ever owned!,,,,,,,,,,,,
676,Very nice and very comfortable,,,,,,,,,,,,
677,This camera is amazing! The picture and sound are so clear. And the set up was so easy!,,,,,,,,,,,,
678,"The Melnor Wand made watering the garden and hanging plants much easier.  I think I am saving water since I can put the water right where I want it.  I have been using it daily for the past month and it is holding up well.  The ""thumb lever"" is easy to use and it allows for precise control of the water volume.  I recommend this Wand.",,,,,,,,,,,,
679,Very good construction.  Cuts easily and cleanly,,,,,,,,,,,,
680,"Why would I only give one star, your ask? Well I received the camera late June, and it stopped working July 12. As it turned out after days attempting to troubleshoot the problem, the return date passed. I've tried contacting the manufacturer per Amazon Customer Service but Blink hasn't called me back or responded. At this point I would gladly just take another camera and hope the problem is not the norm.My advice is if an item doesn't work, don't bother troubleshooting the error, instead just return it. I'll try again to contact Blink technical support, hopefully they'll answer and if the issue gets resolved then I'll edit my review. Otherwise it's only one â­ for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,
681,"This is terrible for making straight cuts on 1/2"" PEX.  Because it is multi'size it cuts smaller tubing crooked, so you end up using a razor blade to make the cuts straight to work with SharkBite PEX fittings or they will leak.   Taking back for refund.",,,,,,,,,,,,
682,The springs are not super strong. I have a pair of clamps that are so strong I can almost not open them up. These have about the pressure you'd expect for the size. The way the body of the clamp is formed there's a hollow area underneath the pad where you hold objects. If you are clamping some thin wood while the glue sets up you would most likely need to use calls under the clamp so that the hollow area didn't affect your gluing surface. The problems I have with these clams may just be due to unfamiliarity. All my other clamps like this are plastic. The two sides can be off as much as 3/16 to a quarter of an inch. Most likely that wouldn't cause a problem I was just surprised how sloppy they were side to side.,,,,,,,,,,,,
683,I recently purchased a Craftsman compressor with 3 airtools these nails did a good job for the diy home project I was doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
684,Easy assembly and looks great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
685,Sprinkler is light weight and tall enough to put water over the tops of our mature shrubs. It is relatively inexpensive so we bought multiples to avoid moving hoses. It joins its 3 wonderful brothers at our home.,,,,,,,,,,,,
686,"Works great, would like being able to adjust it around more though, other that that, works great!",,,,,,,,,,,,
687,Nice cushion and fits your avg outdoor chair.,,,,,,,,,,,,
688,Love it. Very comfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
689,These look even better in person than in the pictures. I ordered two sets to replace the old cushions on my Martha Stewart Charlottetown (Home Depot) wicker loveseat and they fit perfectly! Actually look even better than the original cushions it came with years ago. Would definitely recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
690,"does fine , have had no trouble with them",,,,,,,,,,,,
691,"The nail strips that survived shipping work fine, but several were broken apart and the plastic container was cracked open. You may just want to buy these from your local DIY store unless the price is drastically different. I figure 5% of the nail strips were broken.",,,,,,,,,,,,
692,Good quality screen.  Nice tent.,,,,,,,,,,,,
693,I had a coworker tell me how great this tool was and I am pleased at the performance,,,,,,,,,,,,
694,This gadget eliminated the need for me to crawl into my attic.. works great for ceiling fans,,,,,,,,,,,,
695,This works great and has an easy switch to keep water on so you don't have to continually squeeze the handle.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
696,I purchased the set. One camera stop working.,,,,,,,,,,,,
697,I like it works very well the nozzle adjusts well. from a stream to a spray So far its sturdy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
698,We use these on outside installs and they work prefectly,,,,,,,,,,,,
699,The cushions were were exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly in my chairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
700,Well made metal exterior mount electrical box. I have used a few of these in the past. No complaints.,,,,,,,,,,,,
701,"Works great.  I had to order a separate mounting kit.  That should be included in my opinion.  Other than that, I like the product and the company!",,,,,,,,,,,,
702,"I purchased and installed a few of these cameras, and was pleased at first. Camera quality was good, and didn't take up much space. The mounting options were a challenge, but I made do. When the motion went off, you could review the footage on your smartphone. It also logged each event. Now after a few months, that doesn't work! Unless you are staring directly at your phone when the motion sets the camera off, you CAN'T REWVEIW, OR SEE THE FOOTAGE! BLINK sends you a message saying you have to PURCHASE A PLAN to continue seeing ANY of the camera footage, OR any previous motion event! So now the cameras are basically USELESS unless you want to pay a monthly fee! BUYERS REMORSE!",,,,,,,,,,,,
703,I found it complicated to set up all the different functions and still struggling with a few but I love the versatility it has of audio alarm being able to shut it off recording and the area coverage,,,,,,,,,,,,
704,"The project intended for this item was an outdoor shower. However several of the parts needed for completion were back ordered and will not be received for 2-3 weeks and I didn't want to wait to write the review. The water line is of Â¾ inch PEX tubing (picture 1) and I was amazed at how easily it cut with the Kobalt cutter. The cut ends are clean and there is no deviation in the tubing, which makes inserting fittings much easier. In picture number 2 you can see the difference between the ""Factory cut"" and the Kobalt cut, with the factory cut on the right and showing that the Kobalt cut is even cleaner. The cutter fits well in your grip and it cuts effortlessly through the tubing, which means less fatigue during large projects. The blades are easily removed and replaced (pictures 3 & 4) and replacements are available at Lowes (part #2146990). While using the cutter I found it is also useful in the installation of irrigation tubing, which I use in our flower beds and garden. It easily and cleanly cuts the Â¼ inch drip tubing, which I have previously cut with diagonal pliers and which tends to squash the tube and make it difficult to attach to fittings or multi distribution ports. I understand the Kobalt cutter can also be used to cut Poly Pipe, since I haven't used it in that capacity, I can only assume it will perform the same with that material. With the Kobalt cutter the cut is clean with minimal deviation, which makes the job go much easier and quickly. I'm happy to have this in my toolbox and look forward to it providing many years of service.",,,,,,,,,,,,
705,"Very easy to use, product is a little weak in the corners so be careful, but finished product in window works perfectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,
706,Hard to crimp and it won't cut all the way through,,,,,,,,,,,,
707,I have been using this Orbit for 5 years and ordered more because they are the best. I also ordered some for my grandson's home. Great LARGE area coverage. I am a senior and this is so easy to adjust and use. My lawn is beautiful thanks to this sprinkler.,,,,,,,,,,,,
708,Always great and very handy,,,,,,,,,,,,
709,Great clamps! Easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
710,It was an easy tool to use and great value compared to the big box stores,,,,,,,,,,,,
711,I bought this product for the saftly of our home when we are away for a long time. I can view from anywhere and the oics are clear and clean and also the audio. I dont use the blue light on cam that way intruders cant notice that tuere is a cam looking at them. Over all its a great and easy camera just hook up to your home wifi and you are all set...,,,,,,,,,,,,
712,"Quality is good and I love the color but, even so, the price is too high.",,,,,,,,,,,,
713,Great quality. Heavy duty and will use for many years.,,,,,,,,,,,,
714,Overall I like everything about it however when you flush not very strong.,,,,,,,,,,,,
715,"Good, but beware; this is an inch or so thick and the cutting blade is in the middle of that thickness. If you're trying to save every bit of a pipe stub, you may be better with a sharp knife.",,,,,,,,,,,,
716,All 8 broke within 2 days,,,,,,,,,,,,
717,Love the multiple sprayer settings. Looks as if it is built to last.,,,,,,,,,,,,
718,"Significantly more affordable than our previous American Standard replacement options.  Liquid and ""turbo"" flush options with a simple hold of the flush handle.  And no more leaking water.",,,,,,,,,,,,
719,"very good quality screening , easy to install",,,,,,,,,,,,
720,Handy for holding things like a little vice. Plastic does not leave crimp marks. Made two into a mini sawhorse.,,,,,,,,,,,,
721,"I wanted the newer version, but the price was right on this one. I was not worried about the ""security"" of the camera, so I have no issue with the magnetic mount/. The picture is fantastic and gives me the view I was seeking for the front and blind side of my house. The Nest Aware let me set a specific monitor area so I am not bothered by passing people or cars.",,,,,,,,,,,,
722,does not fit well to hose. water leaking.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
723,"I was disappointed with the new toilet from day 1. After flush, the water would not fill up the tank unless I manually touch the fluidmaster chain (see pictures). Also, I noticed, compared with the picture from AS website (also attached), the fluidmaster tube and valve in my new toilet is located too close to the corner walls which I suspect is the cause of water not filling up the tank because the trigger got stuck against the wall unless I manually released it. It is very frustrating!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
724,"Cushion foam has flattened out and is now only 1.5-2"" thick's. The covers now sag on the cushion.The covers are durable and do well resisting water but the foam doesn't hold up. We have used them for 6 weeks now.",,,,,,,,,,,,
725,Easy to cut with and left a very clean edge on the pex pipe.,,,,,,,,,,,,
726,The product worked as advertised! I used it several times and no issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,
727,More substantial tabs for adjusting width of sprinkler than older model that I replaced.,,,,,,,,,,,,
728,A super deal!! No complaints!! Would definitely buy again!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
729,"We are using the clamps to make wooden ribs for an airplane. These are the best clamps they are strong, sturdy and well-made.",,,,,,,,,,,,
730,"The adhesive separates from the screen and sticks to the backing plastic, so you can't stick it to the screen to repair. Poor quality product that doesn't work. Would not buy again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
731,"feels like a good quality nozel.. works perfectly, except, one of the two I bought started leaking from the head after about a month, the other one is not leaking at all..",,,,,,,,,,,,
732,Perfect fit for my chairs. I wish I had ordered these for my other set. This size is absolutely perfect. Comfortable and I like that they are not bright red. They are a deeper red so they don't look like they will fade. Great quality and super comfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
733,"after about 60% of the nails in a Strip are done, it gets jammed easily; and have to put a new strip IN.",,,,,,,,,,,,
734,Its a good camera. I didnt realize it was not hardwired until after I purchased it.  Anyone can come and unplug or cut the cord attached to the camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,
735,"Great ceiling fan box for new work or old work where attic access is available. Very sturdy for 16"" or 24"" oc joists.",,,,,,,,,,,,
736,Cushions are comfortable!,,,,,,,,,,,,
737,Used for deck spindles feed great through gun and ringshanks hold great,,,,,,,,,,,,
738,"I use it for about 3 plants, and it works great! I have a watering option, a misting option, and a high-pressure option (for cleaning the patio bricks), and they work perfectly. I can't speak for large lawns, but for my little patio it's perfect.",,,,,,,,,,,,
739,"Given all the choices available on this nozzle, it is nit difficult to find the perfect stream you want. This is a well made and sturdy nozzle. AND no squeezing necessaryâ€”the lift action for control is fantastic!See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
740,Interning new tool for new type of pipe and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
741,Easy to use. Quality product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
742,Good value good value for the money. I may have missed this in the fine print: the shell is made in China. They were filled & finished in the USA.,,,,,,,,,,,,
743,Used In my kitchen remodel! Sturdy and well built. No complaints !,,,,,,,,,,,,
744,The rolling tool was not used by me ! It cut the screen ! I used the dull and small screwdriver to push it in instead. The latch was thick so I used my old one.,,,,,,,,,,,,
745,Worked well in my nail gun,,,,,,,,,,,,
746,This sprinkler works great!  Unobstructed oscillation operation with full lawn coverage.  Love it!,,,,,,,,,,,,
747,These clamps work great.  I'm actually using them to determine the proper placement of anchors for a sun sail I'm installing to my back fence wall.,,,,,,,,,,,,
748,"Had cushions for 1 day and the weight of my cat permanently flattened the seat cushion. Lowe's there are so many negatives reviews on these. Please take them off the shelf. When I returned them they were surprised, they said no one has returned these. After looking at the reviews that's hard to believe. Even in the 5 start reviews you can see the cushions are all matted and flattened.",,,,,,,,,,,,
749,work great for cut the pipe for water heater fast and easy,,,,,,,,,,,,
750,"This wand is light ancc do conveniently fits in my hand. The valve opens and closes very easily, better than other models. I bought three to replace all similar wands in my yard.",,,,,,,,,,,,
751,"Best camera I've owned, hands down. It picks up movement and sound better than a bat or mouse. The picture is clearer than my 4k tv. Love this thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,
752,Bought this to replace  An old whirling sprinkler head end up buying 3 total because they worked so well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
753,"Nowadays with everything being made in China, I was very happily surprised when I received these clamps and checked their construction. Two things struck me the most: They are quality constructed and the ends clamp move with the item being clamped. I was impressed. There are five different size clamps which should take care of any project that you are working on. The grips are vinal coated which makes them easy to hold on to. The only thing I can think of that would make these clamps any better and it really has nothing to do with the clamps themselves is if they had holes in one of the grips so the clamps could be hung on a pegboard mounted on the wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,
754,Great finish nails. They never jam up like some do,,,,,,,,,,,,
755,"You really need muscle and leverage to use this wrench. The clamps it comes with are pointless, every single one has broke when you clamp it tight. Or they leak if you try to do a smidge less.",,,,,,,,,,,,
756,"They are nails. Nothing great about them except the price. Nothing bad, either. They go into wood and they stay there.",,,,,,,,,,,,
757,"Love this thing, never thought I'd be leaving a review for a sprinkler but here you are reading it. It's very easy to use to water odd shaped areas with out watering the areas you don't need to. I use it to water our vegetables in the morning, very convenient!",,,,,,,,,,,,
758,Screen was folded in manufacturers packaging. Should be rolled to avoid creases. These creases create unnecessary stress when installing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
759,Did not stock to screens!!! Seemed old. Didn't want to come off plastic. Fell off screens in 24 hrs!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
760,It works well. I bought two of them but I may return one.,,,,,,,,,,,,
761,I had problems with connection sometimes. I need to restart the app and try a couple of times until it connects,,,,,,,,,,,,
762,"Was skeptical about the Brand, after using the same brand for years. Deciding to purchase the and try them out. The main thing I worried about if they would work well with my nail gun. I have used them on my project and they work great with no problems. Would recommend these for sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,
763,Excellent fit and comfortable,,,,,,,,,,,,
764,Love the looks of this. Blends in with our flooring and not all that noticeably. Works like a charm. No more extension cord across the floor!,,,,,,,,,,,,
765,I wouldn't even give these cushions one star!!! These cushions compress and do not return to their original shape. They look like I've had them for 6 years and I've owned them for  2 weeks. I'm so disappointed and now have the hassle of returning them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
766,Easy to put in nail gun,,,,,,,,,,,,
767,"No complaints to speak of. All nails came unscathed. Have purchased other nails that came separated from the plastic collate, but the plastic is relatively thick on these, so they handle shipping without falling apart. These have an added benefit - If you happen to use it as face level, these are great at lightly spraying you with plastic shrapnel, which is good at teaching you not to be a mouth breather.",,,,,,,,,,,,
768,Very good quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,
769,"I bought this sprinkler to water my lawn each night and I think it works great for the low price. The three different modes are nice for keeping the water on the lawn and not in my driveway. Totally recommend if youre looking for a cheap, but high quality sprinkler",,,,,,,,,,,,
770,Horribly made product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
771,"I am so very pleased with this purchase, the brand, the value, durability, customer service, etc. I ordered four sets but also just needed two additional seat cushions (not the back pillows). I reached out to the company and they responded immediately stating that they'd be more than happy to send me additional seat cushions...at no cost!!! Well they went above and beyond that and sent me two more full sets. I live on Maui and it is often a struggle to get products shipped here (if they even ship here at all)...Qilloway spent their time and money sending these to me. If this is not the Aloha way, I don't know what is. The cushions are perfect for the cost and the weather here. They are on the firmer side....you're not going to sink into these. Thank you Qilloway for exceeding my expectations!",,,,,,,,,,,,
772,Great camera! Easy to connect to my internet and to install outside.,,,,,,,,,,,,
773,Keeper is the only issue it broke off,,,,,,,,,,,,
774,"I bought this as an extra sprinkler for our large backyard, works great.",,,,,,,,,,,,
775,"Excellent replacement cushions for a Hampton Bay patio set we purchased 8 years ago. The smaller size actually fits and sits perfectly. Love it!!! Ordered it at a location that didn't have it on hand picked it up at one who had it. No problem. Very, very satisfied with the whole process. Thanx",,,,,,,,,,,,
776,great value and no complaints! Works as described!,,,,,,,,,,,,
777,Made well.  Lots of choices for type of spray.  Heavy duty.,,,,,,,,,,,,
778,The fact that they were two was great and the price was great,,,,,,,,,,,,
779,Nice overall design. Very functional. Moderately thick cushioning.,,,,,,,,,,,,
780,"Adhesives didn't hold up, had to reattach with super glue. Even with that it was still worth it for a cheap and quick window screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,
781,Works great on irrigation pipe,,,,,,,,,,,,
782,It's everything they say it is. Easy to see through. Great value for what you get.,,,,,,,,,,,,
783,Beautiful color and sooo thick!! Can't wait to use them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
784,"Good price, solid product. Really like the rubberized cover which allowed chill free tuning on a cold day. Time honored mechanism provided tight shut off, spray, to full flow. BUT, after i had screwed the nozzle tight on the hose (manually, only, and I'm no neanderthal), the rubber ring on the female end spun without loosening the connection for removal.",,,,,,,,,,,,
785,"This oscillating sprinkler is perfect for watering my yard. I like the adjustability of the range of motion in both directions. It makes the hard work easy by giving my lawn an even watering. Covers a great distance (3,800 sq ft) too!See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
786,"This item is a piece of garbage, I will be returning it! I used this 4 times on 1/2 inch connections, and each time the go-no go gauge would not fit. I kept increasing the force on the tool as the instructions recommended from 0 to 3, trying to get this thing to work with the gauge that came with it, but no success. I will be replacing this with one made anywhere else other than China. I had a plumber friend swing by and let me borrow his tool and gauge, I used it and it worked perfectly. Not sure if the problem is with the Apollo tool itself, or if the gauge it came with is bad. Either way, poor quality! I will be going to my local plumbing supply shop to get the tool my plumber uses. Yes, it will cost about $30 more, but it is made in North America, and works well! I plan on converting 2 houses to PEX, so I need a tool that works well. Needless to say, I am NOT satisfied with this item.",,,,,,,,,,,,
787,Can't beat pet screen!! This screen is of excellent quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,
788,Perfect size to protect new control unit in an outdoor installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
789,Nice inexpensive pex cutter.,,,,,,,,,,,,
790,Beautiful well-made chair cushions!,,,,,,,,,,,,
791,"Size was OK, but because it is folded in the package, you need to work to avoid creases from the folds. In addition, it seems fragile; I had two rips occur while I was gently pulling the screen tight to minimize wrinkles. Luckily, they were close to the edge and I was able to move the material a bit so it was outside of the frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,
792,i used this sprinkler one time and returned it.  The connection at the hose leaked so badly that more water came out of the base than the sprinkler.,,,,,,,,,,,,
793,"superior construction, adaptable to all applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,
794,Much better than those cheap plastic handles. Good pressure and variations. Two thumbs up!,,,,,,,,,,,,
795,it worked very good for our patio door,,,,,,,,,,,,
796,"Liked the fabric pattern and measurements. Did not like the density; too soft, doesn't look good for long term wear.",,,,,,,,,,,,
797,"These clamps aren't well suited for model building with either pine or birch parts, even the small clamps will leave dents. The small clamps are otherwise great, but really only good for max. 5/8"". Just need to be careful what you are clamping togetherThe larger 1"" clamps are next to useless, unless you are only wanting to clamp about the same 5/8, maybe 3/4 max. AND you have extremely strong hands! I'm not kidding--good luck using them, the spring is way too strong and the clamp will crush most anything even remotely soft",,,,,,,,,,,,
798,"Problem--shower head had no adjustable settings.   Bought 2 previously both malfuctioned,  last one in 1 year.  Water sprayed around handle area could not stop it.  I will not buy another Melnor.",,,,,,,,,,,,
799,These worked perfectly with my Hitachi framing nailer for fastening 7/16 OSB to my new shed building project.,,,,,,,,,,,,
800,Simple to use and very sturdy. Performed much better than I thought they would. Used these little gems to hold tile in place when I had to cut to fit.,,,,,,,,,,,,
801,Purchased three of them. Out of the box one didn't work. The other two worked for about five minutes and then went offline never to be heard from again. Currently researching cameras from other companies.,,,,,,,,,,,,
802,"I remember having some cheap cutters like this and loving them, but these didn't work that great compared to my ratcheting cutters",,,,,,,,,,,,
803,"Love the color and design of these cushions, they really add to the look and feel of our porch. Took one star off due to the density of the cushions, but that is to be expected at this price point.",,,,,,,,,,,,
804,comfy and cozy to sit in  bought 6 and everyone agreed  bright red color makes them stand out,,,,,,,,,,,,
805,"With the first few pushes of the water it spun, then it just kept going slower, until it reached almost a full stop. Less water pressure and it wouldn't spin at all. :o( Not willing to try another.",,,,,,,,,,,,
806,"THIS ITEM ISN'T WORTH BUYING. IT'S A WEAK CHEAP @Â°â„¢Â©_()-_##""';'*& I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS.",,,,,,,,,,,,
807,Needed new toilet for bathroom reno. Works great so far and flushes w no issues. Made noise after installed by our bozo contractor who never tests what he installs. I adjusted float and now its fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,
808,"I only had to make 4 connetions. Worked just fine, has been over 2 months, no leaks. I'm happy with it",,,,,,,,,,,,
809,The overall quality of the Melnor 7 pattern nozzle is very good. Some of the patterns don’t seem necessary. I have provided  pictures of patterns that I feel would be beneficial to the user.  Each of these patterns performed well to their title. The nozzle is lightweight and easy to operate. My only concern is the plastic handle for durability. This nozzle needs to be laid down vs. the customary drop while washing one’s car. Using correctly the durability of the nozzle shouldn’t come into question.,,,,,,,,,,,,
810,"Color faded quick. Other than, it is alright. Not a great value as these likely will only look nice for 1 to 2 more summers.",,,,,,,,,,,,
811,"These are 16 ga nails that fit my Ryobi one+ nailer. What more can be said about nails? (It is too soon to know if those already used will stain the wood or rust. So far, still clean.)",,,,,,,,,,,,
812,Great product! Very easy to use! Comes wit everything you need to make screen repair jobs quick and easy! Tool tool included is fantastic! I would definitely purchase this product again!,,,,,,,,,,,,
813,"Yes, you'll save a little money on this thing. However, each and every piece you cut will be at a bad angle rather than the straight, 90 degree cut you are wanting.I've already had to replace this ""money saver"" so don't buy it and really save some money.",,,,,,,,,,,,
814,"It was nice, easy to use",,,,,,,,,,,,
815,"It works well, I don't do plumbing fulltime, so it may not stand the test of time. But for a small gig I think it would be ok.",,,,,,,,,,,,
816,Bar clamps are easy to use. These clamps are of high quality and so you get better results,,,,,,,,,,,,
817,Works well nice assortment of sprays. Thumb lever for water pressure works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
818,great value for 100' of screen,,,,,,,,,,,,
819,Very good quality!,,,,,,,,,,,,
820,"I love the color of these cushions. I was trying to ""save a few bucks"" by ordering these for a futon frame, only to realize how much trouble I will have getting up off the futon. I'm sadly returning them, but have no need of them otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,
821,"Seems very strong for the material it self. Used it along with the Velcro I also bought on line to cover my window a/c unit. Since I have a big pine tree close to it , buy the end of season it sucks in slot of needles and plugs evaporation Drain holes. Which in turn causes rot and mold . Solved with these products. Works great!.",,,,,,,,,,,,
822,Great camera easy to setup,,,,,,,,,,,,
823,its built very well but take it in during winter months it will split. im on my second one.,,,,,,,,,,,,
824,Works great no jams! Get these instead of the cheaper brand.,,,,,,,,,,,,
825,The nails worked great,,,,,,,,,,,,
826,"Handy and convenient. Nice coverage area and spray adjustments. Can place these anywhere you need. Whether you have a large or small space to water, this will do it!See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
827,"This does an excellent job. Not only did it cut cleanly, but it also actually cut through a nest that something had created inside the end of my pex! Very little effort required, too. This was much simpler than the twist cutter I'd been using and left it cleaner.",,,,,,,,,,,,
828,"Cushions are very comfortable, but stitching is poor.",,,,,,,,,,,,
829,The nails don't jam my gun like the old band I was using. Thank god. No more long days of unjamming my gun.  Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,
830,Excellent quality and good price. The cushions are also very comfortable. I really like them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
831,Works great. Very happy with it.will reccomend to my friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,
832,Was not stiff. Too flexible....,,,,,,,,,,,,
833,It was easy to install. And the height is excellent.,,,,,,,,,,,,
834,It's lovely and the quality is great!,,,,,,,,,,,,
835,Our cats have climbed this multiple times in our new catio and it's still held up well!,,,,,,,,,,,,
836,"I shopped around before ordering this set. This is by far the best deal I found and worked flawlessly. To have all three tools in one kit is awesome. I was able to cut the pieces I no longer needed easily, and with the ring remover I was able to reuse pieces instead of purchasing new ones. Crimper worked like a charm. Definitely recommend this kit.",,,,,,,,,,,,
837,"It took me a minute to understand how they work, but once you get it, you realize it's a much faster and more useful design than the screws and such you see in the D clamps and whatnot",,,,,,,,,,,,
838,Nice quality and easy to use material,,,,,,,,,,,,
839,"Being new, I read all I could about pex. New but not scary, I replumbed my whole 3/2/2 house with this tool, even a manifold...It ratchets open when climp is complete. I had not one single leak due to the clamping. This is a good quality tool, as just today i was in home depot and the guys were testing clamp tools and it would not click and they were complaining as to how was they going to be sure clamp was completely sealed. I walked away satisfied that I had a great deal from this seller.",,,,,,,,,,,,
840,I got the navy blue seat cushion and its just what I needed. It fits perfect and very thick and comfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
841,Works as promised and very well built. One issue is that it does not fit well into tight spaces.,,,,,,,,,,,,
842,"This tool isn't easy to use in tight spaces, because it opens so wide. It works great though, and it's very well made.",,,,,,,,,,,,
843,Works great for cutting the 1/2 & 3/4 Pex tubing I have been working with.,,,,,,,,,,,,
844,Works great in pasload air nailer,,,,,,,,,,,,
845,Heavy Duty. Nice buy for the money. Arrived quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
846,Can't really control water pressure .See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
847,The weight and metal base would give a false believe in durability/quality. Not a single full summer of use. The sprinkler head snapped off at the weakest point when I dropped it on the grass. It was satisfactory when wasn't broken but I had full plastic sprinklers that lasted years.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
848,Worked well.  Used over 7000 of these cleats with no issues,,,,,,,,,,,,
849,Operates smooth seems strong,,,,,,,,,,,,
850,"If you want to blast water from a hose, this is the nozzle for you. However, if you've just transplanted fragile plants, don't use this. There is no way to get a gentle spray from it. It's blast or nothing. So I'm going to use it for when I have to hose off concrete blocks or something like that. It seems durable and well-made. Definitely not comfortable to hold for a long time. I guess I'll be purchasing something else that can deliver a gentle spray to my new plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,
851,Fit my small windows great.  The ones that were here were warped and even though I am just renting felt I needed to replace.,,,,,,,,,,,,
852,"If you follow the directions it works great. You get clean straight cuts every time.Be careful though, it is SHARP!",,,,,,,,,,,,
853,Nest Cameras are what we use for home security and monitoring our home when we're away. The video quality is great and reliable and the audio picked up is also great. Notifications are helpful and alert us to any movements around the house. We use 2 Nest Outdoor cameras and a Nest Hello ad our doorbell.,,,,,,,,,,,,
854,Bought for my husband's birthday. He said they worked perfectly and will definitely buy again. They came astoundingly quickly as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
855,"I had trouble getting this into place, because my previous old box was next to an X-Brace and fiberglass insulation. I did not have access from above either from attic floor covered. Maybe took an hour to get in place. After getting it in place it worked great, had to get longer bolts for fan, due to thick drywall.",,,,,,,,,,,,
856,Easy to adjust to water the area you need.,,,,,,,,,,,,
857,unit works great and good value.,,,,,,,,,,,,
858,"Bought 31/4"" nails to install roof rafters & ceiling joists. Nail drive in beautifully, even on angles.",,,,,,,,,,,,
859,"These clamps are very handy, easy to use, and the ability to connect 2 of them into a greater length is a very clever and useful design. The 4 pack is a great savings over buying individual clamps.",,,,,,,,,,,,
860,Defective - Didn't last 6 months,,,,,,,,,,,,
861,We love them! Great quality and very comfortable,,,,,,,,,,,,
862,These are so easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
863,looks nice and works good so far easy to set would buy again,,,,,,,,,,,,
864,Worked flawlessly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
865,Works quite well; allows  me to water my small garden standing up.,,,,,,,,,,,,
866,"Eaay install, great flushing power! I fired off a #23 speical from the ElJennieO mexican joint and it carried it all away with one double pumper power flush!",,,,,,,,,,,,
867,It was a great deal! We got two toilets for two bathrooms for the price of one. Our plumber installed it without any problems. It look nice and work great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
868,This cushion is perfect color/size as a replacement but it has unraveled in the seams in 2 mos of use. Had my previous ones 10 years. Would like a replacement. It is past the return time period. Unsatisfied.,,,,,,,,,,,,
869,"If all you want to do is mount a receptacle in a box, then this bix will do the job quite well. But if you want to mount a GFI outlet then things get tougher ... very crowded. And if you need to chase wires for another downstream box, then it is so crowded it's is almost impossible ... and because that is precisely what I needed to do ... this box is miserable to work with.",,,,,,,,,,,,
870,"Great toilet for the money. The salesman was very helpful, I told him what I needed, he suggested American Standard because he said it's a great product and if you needed parts they were easy to find and a cheap price.",,,,,,,,,,,,
871,It worked great for installing a sink. Was able to get into tight spots to install 1/2 inch Pex Pipe and Crimp rings. It does require somewhat of a strong grip once get the pump-action started. The blue light comes on once the pinch clamp is secured which is a nice feature. The tool released right off the pinch clamp. I made 8 connections and did not have a problem with the tool. $50 is a great value for pex pinch clamp tool.,,,,,,,,,,,,
872,"Well made and well engineered. The knockouts are precisely stamped so they are easy to remove if you need one, but they stay put for the life of the box if you don't. Easy to work with and fairly priced.",,,,,,,,,,,,
873,This was easy to use and supported the fan really well with no wobble or issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,
874,We've just installed these within the past two weeks. So not much history to report so far they work very well and they are CHAIR ( ADA) height which is why we replaced the existing  untis with these. A lot more comfortable for older folks.,,,,,,,,,,,,
875,This is an amazing camera. I'm using it indoors to look out a window near the main entrance. It can identify people in the distance. It seems to handle both intense sunlight and darkness. It is pretty reliable. It did go out during a major thunderstorm. I'm not sure why. It could've been related to the Internet connection. It was incredibly easy to set up,,,,,,,,,,,,
876,Have to use a stake to hold this down or it flips overâ€¦.it is very light. Great coverage now!,,,,,,,,,,,,
877,Easy to install and has good flushing.  I'm not a fan of the plastic seat.  Wish they offered wood.,,,,,,,,,,,,
878,"It works great, would recommend for repair holes in screen, I use it to repair screen pool.",,,,,,,,,,,,
879,They're nice looking but not as sturdy as I thought they'd be.,,,,,,,,,,,,
880,These work perfectly with my Porter Cable and an off brand nailer.  Packaging is fine and can be closed after opening.,,,,,,,,,,,,
881,"Almost didn't buy it as it looks cheap in the picture. Very sturdy, very simple but precise watering controls. Great value. Recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,
882,Easiest spray to use with many spray options.,,,,,,,,,,,,
883,i installed a sink in my backyard using pen pipe. The cutter worked great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
884,"We have two outside hoses. I had bought 2 new nozzles last summer. The first time I went to use them this year, one blew apart then broke at the threaded connection & the other one massively leaked at all the seams - I got a nice shower.This guy being metal feels much more solid and I'm hopeful I will get more then 6 months of use out of it!",,,,,,,,,,,,
885,Good quality. Sharp.,,,,,,,,,,,,
886,Color and size wwere perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
887,"No bad for the price. I had maybe just 6-7 nails that didn't completely puncture our baseboards.Overall, it worked well for are needs and would stil recommend for the price and quantity.",,,,,,,,,,,,
888,Bought sprinkler for my kids to play in. Works great,,,,,,,,,,,,
889,Kit was easy to install. Great quality and price! I recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,
890,"My water pik could clean the sidewalk better... This thing is the biggest farce propagated on the public since the bogus election.  Take $20, roll it up and smoke it.  Because that is the closest thing to satisfaction you're going to find if you waste $20 here... WORTHLESS.",,,,,,,,,,,,
891,I loved that this is weather resistant to anything outdoors and very comfortable!,,,,,,,,,,,,
892,easy to use durable brad nails,,,,,,,,,,,,
893,cushions are as described. generous in size and the color is accurate on the website.,,,,,,,,,,,,
894,"This is a sturdy nozzle is designed to wash away dirt with a pulsating spray. It has a nice comfortable grip with a thumb lever that makes it easy to adjust the water flow, and to turn it on or off. It is recommended for cleaning vehicles, decks, siding and outdoor furnitureMy results cleaning some leaves and dirt off a concrete pad were not very impressive. The same results can be achieved with a regular nozzle set to a forceful stream. This is not to be confused with the cleaning power of a pressure washer. This is just your normal hose water pressure with pulsation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
895,Very easy to cut to size. With the spline tool it makes quick work of changing the screen. The screen makes the window look so much better too.,,,,,,,,,,,,
896,"Aqua Joe works well for me.  I haven't used it much.  But, when I did, all went well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
897,"We have some wild hooligan yellow labs that are less than a year old and they love to jump and scratch at the screen door whenever someone is coming or going. I was getting frustrated at them tearing the screen whenever they got excited, since we usually have the front door open all day with only the screen door closed to keep insects out. I've had this up for a couple of months now and wanted to wait to see if it was really durable before writing a review. It has definitely held up well to repeated clawing by these two dogs, one of which weighs 90 lbs. and the other weighing in at just over 100 lbs. This is definitely one of my best purchases of the year - highly recommend!",,,,,,,,,,,,
898,"I used these 3/4 inch roofing nails in my DeWalt roofing gun. This was for a large shed project. The nails did the job but every now and then one would jam or not be flush with the shingle. That said, this is the first time I tried 3/4 inch nails in this gun. They are very short. Maybe that's why they occasionally misfeed. Maybe it's the gun. But DeWalt says 3/4 inch wire collated nails are OK in the model I own.The price of these roofing nails is reasonable. It's tough to find any hardware not made in China today. I'd gladly pay for Made in the USA. I'd rate the overall quality as decent, not great. The packaging was very sturdy, which I appreciate. Often, hardware made offshore is packed in flimsy, poorly recycled cardboard that falls apart.",,,,,,,,,,,,
899,I like the sleek design I also like that it has a powerful flush,,,,,,,,,,,,
900,We built this couch out of 2x4s. The cushions fit perfectly!!!! Now I just need one more back cushion to fill that gap. I wish I could buy one more back instead of the set!! Other than this. These fit great!,,,,,,,,,,,,
901,"Only had it a few weeks. It works very well and I'm optimistic about how long it will last but only time will tell. The problem with most hose attachments is they don't last more than a few months. And the problem with ones like this is that the valve becomes too hard to move as it gets corroded, but I'm hoping the big handle on this one will keep it in service longer. It certainly works well, and has all the patterns I need. The valve handle looks like it is plastic so it might be the weak point.",,,,,,,,,,,,
902,Needed for cutting .5 cpvc. Worked great!,,,,,,,,,,,,
903,Used this clamp as I needed extra depth to clamp lower when gluing up a tall drawer face. This did the trick with a couple of wood blocks to protect the softer wood face of the drawer! Well built so it should last longer than I will!,,,,,,,,,,,,
904,The pet screen went together nicely Its stronger than the old screen Should last for many years,,,,,,,,,,,,
905,It was easy to install and seems well made.,,,,,,,,,,,,
906,"I'll start by saying I've used best cameras for years and currently use about a dozen at my home. Like most people, we buy the nest cameras because of the nest app. The abil3to easily search clips, scrub a live time-line and ease of app. The battery cams force you to use the Google home app. There is no real way to scrub the time line in real time, the notifications are slow and most of the time the video Isn't ready when I get the notice. The battery is nice, but if you. Choose to plug it...",,,,,,,,,,,,
907,Poor quality. Over priced. Had to be returned. Don't sell them to unsuspecting customers again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,"A lot stronger than previous screen material, but not indestructable. Dog attempted to bite through the screen, a few strands broke, others stretched forming small holes. Was able to fix the stretched ones, but more importantly my dog gave up trying to destroy it. I suspect it wouldn't stop a determined animal, but worked for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,
909,It's not red it looks more like a orange coral red color and it's not thick or sturdy it's thin and not plush so not comfortable and I doubt it can withstand outdoor weather ! I used my red carpet and other red porch cushions as a comparison to the beach supposed red color,,,,,,,,,,,,
910,Used the mesh to make shopping bags. They are super tough and are able to go through the washer so that I can keep my reusable shopping bags clean,,,,,,,,,,,,
911,Easy to use great price for a great product nice and sturdy,,,,,,,,,,,,
912,"This is the second purchase of the same Kohler model, the last one 8 years ago. It has worked so well that I decided to purchase the same model to upgrade another bathroom toilet.",,,,,,,,,,,,
913,Easy to adjust and good coverage.,,,,,,,,,,,,
914,"Not as easy to use as other style clamp. Cheaper, but you get what you pay for.",,,,,,,,,,,,
915,This is a good product if you only need moderate pressure for a project.  The metal rod actually bends under high pressure,,,,,,,,,,,,
916,Firm and well-built housing. Seen some keep looking almost new for over 5 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,A very easy to use tool. Fits the hand well. Extremely durable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
918,These nails work great. Never have a problem with them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
919,Beautiful and thick,,,,,,,,,,,,
920,"Extra sharp, gets into tight places",,,,,,,,,,,,
921,I paid $17 for a small box.  Then went to harbor freight and got the same nails for less than $5,,,,,,,,,,,,
922,Purchased this product to replace old and worn out cushions. It fit the patio furniture perfectly. Very comfortable. Good purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,
923,Real pain in the butt to work with. Stop lock takes a lot to disengage. Bar likes to bend. Not very user friendly. I'll stick to my pipe style clamps.,,,,,,,,,,,,
924,"I put over 10,000 of these nails into my roof. I was concerned that they may be too short, but worked fine adding a second layer of shingles. Very few issues in the nail gun, but I think that had more to do with the gun...or maybe the operator, ha! I would recommend this anytime.",,,,,,,,,,,,
925,"Perfect plug for living room floor. Looks nice and plugs are down under lid, perfect. I installed it so it will be undercouch during reno job.",,,,,,,,,,,,
926,"It's a bar clamp. there's not much to say about them. this one did what it's supposed to do, without breaking, and it was easy to use (as most bar clamps are)... so 5 stars... i guess?",,,,,,,,,,,,
927,"I have 2 children who continually clog the toilet, when one kid goes and clogs it instead of unclogging or letting us know it needs unclogging they leave it, then the next child will go in and go on top of that. We had many clogs before getting this toilet. NOW we NEVER get clogs!!!! I can't explain how nice this is. I would recommend HIGHLY!! The only flaw that I see is that it is on the taller end.",,,,,,,,,,,,
928,Easy to load and exactly what I needed it for,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,"Fit perfectly, slide easily to fit my window width and height.  These are light duty, but hold up the window properly.  I did put some gasket foam with adhesive across the top of the adjustable screen to match perfectly with the bottom of my window to completely keep out the bugs.",,,,,,,,,,,,
930,"This is the best sprinkler I have ever had, and that's numerous that never did a good job.  This sprinkler produces a very neat and precise spray pattern and is very easy to adjust.  Highly recommend it",,,,,,,,,,,,
931,This security camera is so easy to set-up and use. No issues whatsoever. Clear pics and the notices when it detects are a plus.,,,,,,,,,,,,
932,"If you have pets and need screened doors/windows, this is the screen you need...absolutely the best ""pet proof"" screen available.",,,,,,,,,,,,
933,It's a really good durable screen. Need a razor knife to make a cut. Holds the staples and you can get it tight to get the wrinkles out. Would buy it again for sure,,,,,,,,,,,,
934,"Good quality, easy to install , everything needed in box",,,,,,,,,,,,
935,Great nozzle very simple to use with different features,,,,,,,,,,,,
936,Good solid installation for ceiling fan,,,,,,,,,,,,
937,I bought a lot of pavers from Your garden dept. I got to a point where I hade to cut them. I was using clamps  But when tighting them the guide for my saw would move. I had two of these to hold the paver in its place. So I got two more to hold the guides in there place. They work great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
938,The box is very hard to open with the hand. With a screwdriver its ok to open.,,,,,,,,,,,,
939,"To small , didn't fit",,,,,,,,,,,,
940,I've been using these for years. They dont bleed and they hold well,,,,,,,,,,,,
941,The print looks great as an accent to our pool area,,,,,,,,,,,,
942,I researched dual flush toilets for days to replace a ONE PIECE toilet which was a nightmare! This American Standard toilet was easily installed and works great. Highly recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,
943,"Work well in my brad gun, need to have a better reseal package",,,,,,,,,,,,
944,"Not recommend this tool, you got to work a lot on your hands and doesn't cut in a straight line so you got to go over and over. Went back to buy another kind of cutter.",,,,,,,,,,,,
945,So easy to use. Repaired my bathroom window screen. Took me 10 minutes to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,
946,Great quality and a good price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
947,"Solid, rounded. Works great freestanding vs inwall.",,,,,,,,,,,,
948,"Powerful, compact clamp with pads that are easily removed and  lost, possibly by the checkout at HDepot,",,,,,,,,,,,,
949,The summary would not let me change it to average.  The summary is set up so if you give one thing 5 stars then if gives everything 5 stars.  These crimpers are average.  Very heavy and clumsy and for people with arthritis it's pain full to work with.  They will do the job but trying to hold it with one hand a keep the ring in the end of it is a job.  Very pricey at $45,,,,,,,,,,,,
950,Excellent! Replaced leaking toilet and this new toilet definitely performs better.,,,,,,,,,,,,
951,works great in my gun,,,,,,,,,,,,
952,Beautiful colors and excellent quality for the price. I would recommend,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,works great in my new ryobi brad nailer putting up trim,,,,,,,,,,,,
954,"I love the looks of these cushions. They are just a little too small for my chairs, which were bought at Lowe's. They are also not quite as comfortable as the original ones, but for the price, they are great!",,,,,,,,,,,,
955,"bought this just to use inside. It never works. Actually had to return the first one because it never would connect. Well, the second one isnt much better. Goes offline all the time. App is glitchy and there is a major delay between the feed and the app. Takes forever to move the camera and look around. Just spend a little more money and buy something better. Hate i wasted my money on this. It never worked right from the get go.",,,,,,,,,,,,
956,Narrow tank but tall opens up my tiny bathroom a bit. Easy to assemble and fits my Brondell washlet perfectly,,,,,,,,,,,,
957,"I love this camera! The night vision is so clear. Actually, the picture/video is all crystal clear. The only drawback for me, and it's not really a major one, is the slight delay on the motion detection. There have been times when I have walked out of my house and had up to a 7 second delay before the notification on my phone chimes. I have this camera focused on my porch to monitor deliveries and potentially be able to communicate with delivery people if they are leaving the packages where they can be easily seen from the street. As seen in the screen shots, we have plenty of opportunity for them to be left where someone passing by can't see them. Unfortunately, because of the delay the delivery people are usually gone before I even get notified that motion was detected.",,,,,,,,,,,,
958,Pretty good. If you area is larger I recommend just going with the larger one. This definitely didn't seem to cover 3000 sq. ft. Overall good product for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
959,Purchased this product to retro in a new light fixture.  Made the installation very easy and fast,,,,,,,,,,,,
960,"I purchased this to try it for a small lawn--I still have to move it to water everything, but I'm not wasting a lot of water spraying on the house, deck, or into neighbors' yards. I don't have great water pressure so I'm not getting as much coverage as I'd like but that's my problem, not the sprinkler. Also, the various settings provide a lot of flexibility to cover one direction only, a rectangle, etc. versus the circle only.",,,,,,,,,,,,
961,"I got these for random odd jobs around the house, and I love them. They are totally decent quality for the money, and are actually kinda fun to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
962,Super easy to install and set up. Was a great purchase and addition to our home security system.,,,,,,,,,,,,
963,It was easy to install did take long at all now my dad wants one,,,,,,,,,,,,
964,perfect application and fit. All parts necessary for job,,,,,,,,,,,,
965,"This product works as described.As expected I did have to remove the old ceiling box.  This was the slowest part of the job working through a 4"" hole in the ceiling.The people who rated it low did not follow the directions or lacked any mechanical ability.  The ""C"" mounting is stamped for proper installation direction; if you don't it will block the cable hole.  The clamping pressure that this device will apply between the ceiling joists is very good, again, if you follow the clear directions.",,,,,,,,,,,,
966,Toilet came in good condition and did not have cracks like previous orders did. Overall good experience with the delivery service as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
967,Great product for the price !,,,,,,,,,,,,
968,These nails are easy to use in my hitachi nailer. They work well and are strong. No complaints although I have only shot about 20 nails so far,,,,,,,,,,,,
969,"At the price point, this sprinkler is an excellent choice for a simple and quick solution to watering a medium size area.  With our given water pressure, it was able to reach about a 40 foot radius, which was perfect for us.",,,,,,,,,,,,
970,"Easy to use, easy to cut and just the right amount for the job I needed",,,,,,,,,,,,
971,Works perfectly!,,,,,,,,,,,,
972,Nice quality and cleans easily,,,,,,,,,,,,
973,Works as advertised. Easy to set up and use. Would buy again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
974,"How much can one say about a nozzle? These are very well made, quality nozzles at an excellent price.",,,,,,,,,,,,
975,Excellent Product and Quality!Thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,
976,"The cushions are excellent quality, very thick and comfortable. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I'm not sure why my photos are showing swirl marks but that's light in photo and not a pattern in the cushions.",,,,,,,,,,,,
977,"Tough time trying to figure out how to open the lid, no directions.",,,,,,,,,,,,
978,"I have a porter and cable nail gun, but the heads of the nail is too big to pass through the chamber",,,,,,,,,,,,
979,Easy to install and use. Is not a high resolution camera at all but works for general awareness of action where covering,,,,,,,,,,,,
980,Great quality and fab colors,,,,,,,,,,,,
981,These work well - fired several hundred of these and haven't had an issues with jamming and they hold well - works in both our pneumatic hitachi nailer and cordless milwaukee nailer,,,,,,,,,,,,
982,"Worth the price. It's tempting to buy a cheap replacement toilet, especially when you aren't in your forever home. But seriously, spend the extra $ for this one if you can. Powerful flushing, yet requires minimal water. With the daily loads deposited in my house this toilet accommodates, even with lots of TP. Have the same toilet in another bathroom; has NEVER clogged or overflowed in almost three years.",,,,,,,,,,,,
983,I used these to hold v groove planking boards. They work great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
984,Easy to use. EXCELLENT value for money,,,,,,,,,,,,
985,Easy to install.  Heavy duty fan support.,,,,,,,,,,,,
986,Glue holding string off bead nails won't hold well the buckle and fold upon inserting into loading bay,,,,,,,,,,,,
987,"Very nice toilet. Easy to install and operate. My wish was that the manufacturer would have provided more measurement information. I had hoped to install this in place of the original toilet, but had to install new sections of the flooring because my estimates from the measurement information given was incorrect. Also had to replace the water valve from the wall because the width of the toilet at the rear interfered with operation of the valve.",,,,,,,,,,,,
988,"Already had a next doorbell and the nest subscription service so I decided to add a couple outdoor cameras to the system. QR code scan was easy to add the camera to the system. Great video quality, smart/compact design. The only negative in this older model is the mid cable power puck module. Which was corrected in the new IQ version",,,,,,,,,,,,
989,perfect pads and perfect price,,,,,,,,,,,,
990,"This is very easy to install and very sturdy.  I would add a couple of minor things to the instructions......how to remove the box from the bracket,etc.  I bought three of these and would buy them again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
991,easy to assemble. sure beats the price of having to send out to be replaced!,,,,,,,,,,,,
992,The height for helping a sick person on to the toilet,,,,,,,,,,,,
993,The mounting threads are poorly cut or too shallow. Broke one screw head completely off bottoming out. Lowes should stop carrying this product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
994,Worked out well but you do need attic access to properly secure this. We'll made and worked well for ceiling fan install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
995,"the review said this item was super easy to install, I am here to tell you it was the easiest installation of a ceiling fan I've ever done. product works fantastic!",,,,,,,,,,,,
996,"great price and great product , but why it could not have been sent to my home depot 1.2 miles away and made md drive 15 miles to another store. i was not happy about that at all",,,,,,,,,,,,
997,Love the sleek back and powerful flush.,,,,,,,,,,,,
998,"I destroyed the original screen, and they wanted stupid money for an original replacement - nope!This kit's a good substitute at a fraction of the price. Takes less than an hour to install.",,,,,,,,,,,,
999,Quality tool and clamps for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1000,Terrible. Don't expect this to work without keeping a close eye on them. They'll quite often get stuck and will leave you with a nice puddle when you go check. Do yourself a favor and get something that's better quality maybe a metal one.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1001,"Needed to keep an eye on someone who was stuffing my mailboxâ€¦ grrr. The indoor cam fits nicely on my window and pokes through the curtains. No one is the wiser that I can see everything that is delivered to my mailbox and front door. This is the easiest installation ever. My condo association doesn't allow outside cameras, so putting an indoor camera in my window pointing to the mailbox is perfect. Just make sure the camera isn't in the sunshine and you are good to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1002,"The tool itself is a sturdy tool with a clever idea to seal with the clamps enclosed. What I bought it for was to seal a lightweight air hose to connectors for air tools. But, the hose still leaked.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1003,Works great and easy to set up. Installation varies on your personal requirements. I wanted to add an additional outdoor camera. Adding a new camera via an existing account is very easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1004,Camera disconnects and is unable to reconnect. Numerous complaints on internet. Worked for a couple days then disconnected. Not worth debugging. Returned product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1005,I love our Ring products. We just moved and our new house has no lights in the driveway. This light is so bright it lights up the whole driveway. I love it.The only thing I will say people might not like is it does detect cars driving by. I personally am fine with it. The other thing people might not like is it is plug in. My husband is handy and made it look great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1006,"I bought 4 of these to install in a 3 season sun-room. The first one was very difficult, the box is very deep so getting the wires in and hooked up was hard, plus they are too deep for the plastic vapour barrier. I learned from the first one so for the second one, I allowed enough wire to hook everything up out side the hole in the floor. I also took the plastic vapour barrier box and made it 2 inches longer using tuck tape and this worked great. Make sure to use the exact size the template gives you as there is no room for error. By the time I got to the forth one, it was easy. These look great and are very functional. the top protects the plugs if not being used and hides the cords for those in use. Really glad I bought them.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1007,"This product would be five star if it were resistant to raccoons.  It worked great for cats, but the raccoons broke through in a couple of hours.  The product is easy to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1008,I never did screen repair. This was simple and the quality was perfect. The only thing I did different was I got a heavier duty tool to install the material to keep screen in place. I bought 2 extra rolls and fixed my mother in laws screens also. Highly recommend this,,,,,,,,,,,,
1009,I can see who's coming and going and when packages arrive. It has been great during home construction and know when my housekeeper is there. Amazing camera quality!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1010,I love these handy little screens. I can get airflow when installed screens are torn or missing. Very useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1011,"Great tool for the price. I've tried another leading brand and these perform as good, if not better, for half of the cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1012,I have 3 connected by hoses and they water my large yard perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1013,They came all together and in good order. Will order again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1014,"Device sits right on my window seal, super clear, easy to hook up to app on my phone!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1015,"Safety first, easy to install",,,,,,,,,,,,
1016,"This item is very sturdy and looks great.....However, I believe it has some serious design problems. It places the actual receptacle about two inches below floor level making it most difficult insert a plug. The single cover needs a serious screwdriver/lever to pry open, due to a Rube Golberg-designed latch/hinge mechanism. Overall, I was not impressed by the design and returned the item for a refund.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1017,"Great toilet, easy to install, and meets everything we expected. Would have gotten a 5 star review, but plugged the very first time our 5 year old used it. Hasn't plugged since though.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1018,Works great for retrofit work,,,,,,,,,,,,
1019,"I needed two small c-clamps to make a quick ""metal brake"". These were cheap enough and worked quite well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1020,Basic sprinkler. Good deal for the price.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1021,"I love it. We really needed a new toilet and we went with this one because it had all the things we needed, like the wax ring and toilet seat",,,,,,,,,,,,
1022,The ground spike broke after a weeks worth of use. it completely bent into a 'u' shape and fell over! I came out to find one pointed at the neighbors yard on still instead of pulsating and another pointed into the ground and straight into the sky watering the woods! The spring that allows pulsating comes loose on its own without question. I constantly had to give it a repair to get it to work again. you get what you pay for I guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1023,"Like the headline says it's easy to use to repair window screens. Warm day, measure and cut, peel backing off slowly and apply. That's it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1024,This is the second one purchased within 2 weeks both started leaking on the side under the plastic nameplate. Don't waste your money,,,,,,,,,,,,
1025,I bought these back in December and at first I loved them and even bought a second set. But after two months the night vision no longer works on one of the cameras which defeats the purpose of me having them right now. I've tried everything even restarting them but with no luck. Unfortunately I will have to search elsewhere. If night vision is not something you need then these are great esp for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1026,"I don't know if it will really flush a bucket of golf balls, but I do know it really flushes. Works great!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1027,The instructions were easy to understand. The framing material was sturdy and made assembly a snap.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1028,Lazy boy cushions were moldy after 8 winters and no cover. These were deeper than what i need but still looks great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1029,"Works very well, although only used it once.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1030,easy install and came with all the tool for a good price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1031,I have used it four times and am happy with it. Stronger than the plastic ones for sure and easier to set the range of the spray. We'll see as time goes on whether it lasts so haven't rated durability.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1032,These are good clips. They are real strong. They hold everything I use them on.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1033,Works well for what is needed,,,,,,,,,,,,
1034,This seat cushion is great unless of course you want to sit on it pathetically small light flimsy and cheaply made,,,,,,,,,,,,
1035,I ordered these in blue and they are very nice. They are a thick comfortable cushion and very well made. The dimensions were exactly as stated. I highly recommend them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1036,Good tool for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,
1037,"I have 2 of these in my front yard and 4 in my backyard.  They are easy to adjust, and do exactly what they are supposed to do.  I have mine set at maximum water and as it gets to the house I have them set to lose the pressure so I don't nail the front door and kitchen window.  There is a curve in my front yard and I have them adjusted to follow that curve so the grass gets water, but if I park a car there the car won't get wet.  I have had mine for 3 years now with no issues. I need to replace one of them as I hit it with the mower.  I was glad to see Lowes still sells these!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1038,We bought these at the beginning of last summer and by the end of the summer the cushions were flattened and not comfortable. I'm having to buy new ones again this year because these are too uncomfortable to sit in anymore. I spent almost $400 on cushions that was completely wasted.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1039,Really good quality of the sprinkler. Works wellIn the garden,,,,,,,,,,,,
1040,"Since we have a crawl space below we adjusted the box very deep beneath floor by using the built in adjustment bolts. Plugs themselves unseen just the cords going into the box, glad we found this. Much better than exposed plug ends and/or the visible flaps.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1041,"Pipe cutters suck. I use these everyday to cut 3/4"" - 1"" pvc pipe and the completely fell apart after one month of use. The blade is chipped and cracked in multiple places. Very cheap and very poor quality cutters",,,,,,,,,,,,
1042,Well made and makes cutting pvc easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1043,Bought this to cut through pvc for my social distancing Halloween Candy delivery tube. Made the job tons easier. Highly recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1044,I just followed the instructions and it worked fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1045,"Was asked by a client to install a receptacle in the middle of their living room that has hardwood flooring but they wanted something aesthetically pleasing yet readily convenient, serviceable and rugged enough for the abuse it would be subjected to.  This unit was chosen and was pleasingly accepted.  Happy client makes for a happy electrical contractor.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1046,Cuts with no hesitation. Like them alot,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047,Good quality. Great way to update patio.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1048,"Easy to install, looks great, but pops out easily (if you have kids that bump or push on the screen)",,,,,,,,,,,,
1049,Ok but wish they were made of better plastic,,,,,,,,,,,,
1050,Great quality and price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1051,Works exactly as needed and has a sure grip when making the cut.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1052,high quality tool and works great ...recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1053,Quality of the toilet was poor.  The chain connecting the handle crumbled as soon as we filled the tank.  Would not buy Koehler again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1054,It did not cut straight. The cut was always at an angle no matter what I did.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1055,the box is not connected to the brace very well.  I would have expected more sturdiness in the design.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1056,"If you are on the fence about buying this product, look no further and do yourself a favor... please buy this clamp set. i think they work perfectly for my projects that require clamps. i will absolutely be buying 2 more of these packs (can never have too many clamps lol). great price, great product and great buy all around. #recommended with 6 stars if i could, i need to sit down.... starting to sound like I'm going to marry this item! But that's how satisfied i am!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1057,"These clamps are made well. They are plastic, no metal to rust. They have a nice tight clamp as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1058,This is a great nozzle!  Love the different patterns and it's very sturdy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1059,"I love this toilet, it's amazing that a toilet which uses so much less water can have such strength and is quiet. We bought 2 and are happy with them",,,,,,,,,,,,
1060,Box broken to pieces,,,,,,,,,,,,
1061,"Extremely easy to set up with app. Installation is a easy as it can be with all hardware included, depending on where you locate cameras. Harder with no power outlets outside, but not a big issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1062,Worked as the extra set of hands I needed to complete my project.Not a very strong back bone and will spread if over tightened.I would rate this clamp as light to medium duty.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1063,Heavy duty and strong outputs. like it very much.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1064,Worked with so much ease and is way cheaper than stores.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1065,Works really good for the garden and to get wetSee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1066,Look nice and seem durable,,,,,,,,,,,,
1067,"I'm giving this review 6 months after replacing my 1970's toilet with this one. It works great!Installation was straightforward and easy. I'm a big guy at 6'-3"", 260#. I was concerned about how the toilet would work with it's miserly water flow compared to my old one. This Kohler absolutely works fine! I'm renovating my second bathroom now and will buy the same one again. Great value too.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1068,The love color and excellent quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1069,It is good for the home handyman that uses it occasionaly. I put mine in my camper in case i have issues. It cuts good but it is plastics.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1070,"It looks very nice and rich, like the photo.  It does seem a little ""thinner"" than the pad I had last time, but the price was good so I'm not complaining.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1071,"We ordered these as replacements for Oak Heights cushions that had worn out after 2-3 years.These are nowhere as comfortable nor filled, to the extent that you feel the slats of the chaise lounge chair through the cushion. I'm very disappointed and wish I hadn't made this purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1072,"this stuff is super easy to cut, assemble and install as long as you have some basic hands on type skills. One warning though; as you install the screen resist the urge to pull it tight and get the slack out. If you do you will warp the frame. When you install the spline the screen will pull itself tight.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1073,"ASIN: B07T2YG963According to the description, it can cut ""up to 1-5/8"" inches"".I bought this on 8/22/20 and been using it on 1/2"" and 1"" pipes.Today, I have a need to cut 1-1/2"". It was a disappointment. Can't even fit a 1-1/2"" pipe in the jaw of the cutter. To get the job done quickly, I had to use a hack saw for my 1-1/2"" pipe.The product description is false and misleading.If you're looking to cut pipe larger than 1"", don't buy this.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1074,Great price and easy to use for the average guy,,,,,,,,,,,,
1075,"I have used these clamps, in place of my 12 inch visegrip style clamps.I like them because I get better tighten capabilities, then pliers typeI would like to see them built a little stronger for longer life",,,,,,,,,,,,
1076,These finish nails work great! They never jam up or break apart like some of the other products on the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1077,"Used with a air gun, no nail jams.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1078,"I was very glad to find this size screen for my purpose, but the screen material began to come loose right away.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1079,Great brads. They fire smoothly through my cordless Ryobi 18 gauge nailer. So far no miss  fires or gumming up. Would recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1080,"Easy to use,get the job done.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1081,I have used this nozzle for months and I am very happy with it. I like the ability to turn off the nozzle while still having the water running to the hose. I would definitely buy this again.The water soaker setting and the center settings are settings I used most. It is nice to have multiple settings if I need them,,,,,,,,,,,,
1082,"durable, easy to use, effective. thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1083,"I am please with this product. Nothing crazy, just does the job. It is about 8"" long. Cuts up to 1""OD, easy to replace the place, and has locking grip so it fits in my bag nicely.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1084,These clamps work great. They are small but strong and are very easy to use. Would definitely buy again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1085,Very sharp worked great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1086,Nice and thick. Very comfortable!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1087,But I couldn't get it to stop leaking! Leaked where the tank attaches to the bowl. Tried multiple times. Had friends help. Had a plumber try even!  Finally just returned it. Not worth the hassle of a brand new toilet is already leaking!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1088,"Nice, thick and firm.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1089,I've used similar priced sprinklers that did not have markings on the dial and would eventually crack after a month or so. This one has been great and is still working like new after a month. The dial has markings for the direction the water sprays which makes is easier to adjust so I'm not spraying my cars in the driveway.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1090,"Simple to use.  No need to access the attic.  All that is required is a 4"" x 4"" hole in the ceiling, and a little tenacity, to secure the box between the joists.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1091,"Works well, super well built. I only wish you could adjust width of spray. It would be 5 stars if you could.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1092,This is a small but strong metal material. Very good spray.LikesOperationDurabilityConstructionSee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1093,Works like a charm. does feel a little flimsy. Feel concern about bugs go in between the screens.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1094,Bought this for camping and now I want one at the house. I love it and I am super picky with sprayers. It's the perfect size and spray. We use it for spraying sandy feet but it would work for all my needs at home as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1095,The camera part is great... The talking back and forth sucks... Will try to figure out if there is a better way to communicate with the camera features.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1096,I've been using this brand nails for my Dewault 20 volt nailer since I got it. These nails are tightly held together. I've only had a few jams and I believe that was my fault. Loading is easy and all the nails are in perfect line. They don't jam in my nailer. At least they haven't in the couple years I've had the Dewault nailer. I will continue to buy this brand nails.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1097,Have had it over a month it works great! For the price it's a good deal,,,,,,,,,,,,
1098,Great quality and very comfortable!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1099,These are now new clamps with black rubber works good just more bulky,,,,,,,,,,,,
1100,"I try connecting it to my wifi and it didn't work. I called Amazon they transfer the call to the Blink company they try helping me with the set up but nothing. I was told my the associate he will send me a new one and I would just have to send this one back, never got the second one. Here I'm home with a camera that don't work and I can't even get my money back because is past the time. Ended up ordering a different brand not a Blink and this one works great.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1101,These are just fantastic looking and very comfortable! Looks great on our front porch and we get lots of compliments on them,,,,,,,,,,,,
1102,This was very easy to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1103,"Love how fluffly the cushions are, very comfortable",,,,,,,,,,,,
1104,"I received the table, looks nice, still waiting on the chairs!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1105,"The sprinkler looks well made however, an additional piece was required for us to be able to hook up the hose to it. Also not as powerful as it states and we would need to move it to various areas of the lawn to be able to cover the whole area. I will be returning this as the main reason for purchasing was the fact that it advertised as covering up to 32-49 ft which it clearly does not.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1106,"Light, powerful and small.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1107,"easy to use it, looks very protective",,,,,,,,,,,,
1108,The product worked well and made the job I was doing a lot easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1109,"I just bought 2 of these toilets and have to return them, they keep leaking water, we fill the tank and less then 5 mins water is gone, don't waste your time and money on this",,,,,,,,,,,,
1110,"Excellent cam,easy install,just add to other cams on ring app!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1111,Solid product. Works great and easy to tell the modes,,,,,,,,,,,,
1112,Easy to install stretch and staple very durable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1113,"I bought 2 of these nozzles. They worked great for 9 months. Then within 1 week of each other, they started to leak badly from where the nozzle is attached to the handle. These are designed to fail! There is a 5 year warranty, but since we are outside of our 90 day return window we have to deal directly with the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1114,"This is a new designed watering wand.  The multiple spray setting is fantastic, ranging from mist to jet.  I normally use the ""shower"" and ""mist"" setting when watering my plants.   The flow or on/off is a new design, much improved over the old trigger style with less moving parts that can go wrong. I wish the wand is slightly bend at an angle rather than completely straight.  Overall this is an excellent watering wand.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1115,Great lighting and camera system linked quick and easy up other ring cameras added security,,,,,,,,,,,,
1116,"For my particular application, the scissor-like tube cutter worked perfectly. I needed to get into a very tight spot to install a ball valve on both 1"" water lines. I bought this one because of its small size. For the 4 cuts I made, the cutter easily cut a square smooth cut.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1117,"These cushions are comfortable and look very expensive. More importantly, they fit my existing patio furniture and my budget!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1118,Watched a YouTube video about ensuring I had the right product and installation; the product worked exactly as designed and we were able to hang the ceiling fan with no issues,,,,,,,,,,,,
1119,"Still learning how to navigate through the settings....previously had Swann wifi system, but the wifi kept cutting out. Miss the sound option. Defender 4k should have had audio. Wish the continuous stream showed ""red"" events on the playback timeline - overall the video quality is great, and like the fact that you can zoom into the images. Good value for the buck!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1120,Yes. Well worth the money and convenience of having the spline and spline tool included in the package. I even have some extra screening left over from the job. A very good deal..,,,,,,,,,,,,
1121,Very very nice product very cheap and shipping fast,,,,,,,,,,,,
1122,"I got this sprinkler to help keep my garden and lawn watered in this scorching heat we've been having lately. Its a really nice sprinkler. The hands spin freely and easily as the water goes through them, covering a great amount of area at once. I don't have to go out and move my sprinkler around like the old school ones since this one spins and does that for me with the spinning of the hands instead of the back and forth wave the old school ones have. Great for the price and works like a charm.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1123,"Bought 2 yesterday and both are getting stuck to one side...will be returning today...now I know why the box of one of them was wet, probably happened to someone else and they did the same as I'm about to do.coverage is great and its easy to use but if its not oscillating correctly what's the point?",,,,,,,,,,,,
1124,"This does a great job cutting schedule 40 3/4 inch PVC pipe. Like others have suggested, try this out on scrap pipe to get a feel for how to get flat and square cuts. Price is a bargain.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1125,"I used a box and a half already and they worked great, no hang ups or misfires. I highly recommend these nails to anyone with a 21 degree nail gun.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1126,"Unless you have a new device to link it to, the Blink camera is unusable. The newest app for the Blink is NOT backward compatible with older Ipads and other older devices, and you CAN'T use it with your computer.I now have a 90 dollar doorstop. There is no workaround either, and since there is no way to use it with a computer, IMHO its worthless.Avoid buying this product unless you plan on updating or replacing your wireless device on a regular basis.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1127,Great product.  Expands or contracts to fit window width.  Much simpler than having screens manufactured to fit existing windows.  Does what it is supposed to do at a reasonable price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1128,"sprayed about 7 or 8 feet, not 70 or 80 feet as described.  I played around with the hookup and made sure the water pressure was strong but no change in the amount of water coming from the sprinkler. Called the number on the box which said use the online ""customer care""  for help.  It was useless.  Called a number and the man was nice but said there are no adjustments on the sprinkler that would help with water flow/pressure so it must have been defective.  He offered shipping a replacement which would take 3 -5 days.  I needed it today. Taking it back to Lowes.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1129,Have already used it.... simple and works well with the PEX I am working on,,,,,,,,,,,,
1130,"Great quality, very comfortable. A great fit for our porch chairs.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1131,Have only had this toilet for less than a year and have had to mess with the flapper multiple times to stop constant water running into the bowl. Typical toilets have one flapper but this one has two you constantly have to trouble shoot.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1132,works well for price,,,,,,,,,,,,
1133,These finish nails perform great! They dont jam up or break apart like other brands on the market,,,,,,,,,,,,
1134,Great job. Cut right through the plastic pipe leaving it smooth ready for the next step.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1135,Bought these crimpers because the ones I had weren't holding 100%. They worked great and the price was good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1136,Worked great with no jams.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1137,Installed about two weeks ago and it seems to be holding up. I've already had a cat climb up the screen several times with no rips or other damage to the screening.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1138,They have perfect strong grip,,,,,,,,,,,,
1139,"These are beautiful outdoor pillows. Make sure you measure you seats first so the fit pe4ectly...Mine did ,,and the color I picked makes me feel like Im someone exotic like Greece or Amalfi coast.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1140,"Very nice clamps. Well made, great price.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1141,great look and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,
1142,Terrible quality,,,,,,,,,,,,
1143,I replaced the wire screen on my door with the fiberglass screen and and it looks a lot better.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1144,"Easy to use. Holds tight, works great",,,,,,,,,,,,
1145,easy load no jams..,,,,,,,,,,,,
1146,"This was so easy to screw unto my hose. It fit well, and snug. The quality is quite durable and I believe that it will last me for quite some time. The water pressure is very strong in my opinion. I use it to wash my car and also to water my lawn and trees. Recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1147,"Seems decent quality, my first vise though so I don't have much insight. One big thing though is the back gripping lip doesn't seem to clear the base very well so mounting on the corner of the bench was tricky.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1148,High quality product. Easy to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1149,They fit into the slots of the DeWalt foldable work table.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1150,The fit of the back cushion is not quite what I expected and doesn't work as well for my particular physique.  Will keep cushions anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1151,"Gorgeous outdoor throw pillows! Bought two of the outdoor throw pillows and two of the outdoor chair cushions!! They are very comfortable, excellent padding and fluff. The chair cushions are memory foam and the throw pillows are a fluffy hypoallergenic fiber fill. The fabric on all 4 items is weather proof seem to be doing great in my southern spring storms. Easy to wipe down if needed. The chair cushions have cover that unzips and can be thrown into the washer. Will be buying more of these",,,,,,,,,,,,
1152,"perfect for me, I have small hands and it fits perfectly.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
1153,"Well made, and gave me no issues when I installed it.  Hard to say much more....",,,,,,,,,,,,
1154,"Have Irwin clamps and wanted same. But Lowes now has Jorgensen. Sigh. Had to take those. Boy am i glad i did! They are awesome!!!You can clamp together and apart, and you can combine 2 to make a longer one (as long as they have the same lb-rating!Now i want to replace my old clamps all with Jorgensen!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1155,The camera is very easy to install. My son help me with set up and had it connected to my existing nest app in no time. Very easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1156,My dog has chewed the plastic off of two nozzles! I don't think he can chew this one.I used it the first tome today and so far so good. It doesn't leak. It does get hot if left in the sun! ðŸ˜Š,,,,,,,,,,,,
1157,"Works great, heated seat and the night light is great for night time needs.  Auto flushing is a great addition tied in with the auto seat open and close. Last, who can fail to mention the great warm water bidet and dry function.  Everything works great, am very happy with my purchase",,,,,,,,,,,,
1158,I got two but I'm going to purchase 4 more. Very comfortable thick cushions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1159,The cushions fit perfectly on our patio chairs. I love the thick cushion and how comfortable they are.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1160,"Bought this cheaper PEX cutter because I had only three cuts to make in 5/8"" pipe.  Works fine when you practice with a short piece of pipe at your computer desk where you can rotate the pipe in the cutter.  It easily slices through the pipe.  But when lying on your back in a crawlspace working overhead next to a floor joist, it is a different story.  If you are not very carefully aligned, it will cut a never-ending spiral in the pipe.  There goes the critical length plus 1 inch for the SharkBite push-fit fittings.  Have not tried it on the larger sizes of pipe in its range.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1161,"I am very happy with the way the screen looks. It was easy to put on but it is a tedious project. Unfortunately the tool that was recommended to put the spline in did not fit in the grooves. So I had to first push the screen in with a screwdriver, then use the tool to push the spline in as far as it could go, and then use the screwdriver to push the spline in further.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1162,"Smooth,  jam free in my Ryobi Airstrike gun.....",,,,,,,,,,,,
1163,Not very well made. Thickness is not that great meaning not filled with enough cushion. We'll see how long it lasts.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164,"Simple, easy install, nice seat",,,,,,,,,,,,
1165,"This works well, but my only issue is that the spray is wide, and can leave a dry area.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1166,returned doesnt cut squarely. returned,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167,Great price and really clean cuts.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1168,"Very powerful flush.  It has been over a month since installation, this new Glacier Bay toilet never clogged.  Compare to my old toilet that clogged almost every other day, it is unbelievably amazing!  I am very happy with my purchase but only one drawback is a toilet seat.  How hard tighten up the bolt, it starts loosening.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1169,It seems like a solid unit. I could adjust it to aim where it should water. It's perfect for larger areas. Nice flow.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1170,Very easy one hand positioning and tighten up nicely.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1171,It says medium duty but I am using it to hold 8 ft fencing planks with no trouble.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1172,"Perfect for situations where you can't access above. This ceiling fan brace presses into the joists on either side and makes a secure mount for a fan or heavy hanging light fixture. My situation didn't have an existing box, so I drilled the recommended 4 inch hole, passed the new box through the hole then turned the bar causing the bracket to expand into the joists. Very secure and strong. Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1173,Bought 2 of these. Good for my smaller front yard and garden area. I have a huge back yard and it says 2000 sq ft but that is far from the case. There's no clear directions on how to adjust the settings. Good for very small spaces and saturates well.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1174,Love these. Comfortable & well made.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1175,"Easy installation, all features work as advertised",,,,,,,,,,,,
1176,"Quality, well built . The premade knocks made the job quicker and easier.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1177,"The nails worked well, but in three different brands of framing nailers, the last three nails per strip wouldn't feed. Even when backed up by a new strip of 21, the machines refused to cycle this particular brand of nail. The plastic collation is thin enough that the last three neails can be stripped from the plastic and used traditionally though. So they're still useful.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1178,"I needed to replace the ceiling fan in our 12 x 14 bedroom. We purchased one from Home Depot (LED lights with remote). I thought it would be a simple ""plug and play"" using the existing box to hang the new fan. WRONG! The box that the previous owner had hung the fan from was a regular nail in place plastic box nailed to the joist with one scew stripped out and the other barely hanging on with mostly stripped threads. Why the previous fan never fell on top of us in bed remains a mystery. At least I now know why the old fan wobbled.I purchased this because I previously used one in another bedroom when I replaced a light fixture with a ceiling fan. It worked great. I have no attic and no access above the ceiling. I would have to cut through the torch down roof and the underlayment to install support for a fan.This did the trick. Even though the old box was nailed to the joist, I was able to cut the old nails off through the 4"" hole with a oscillating saw to remove the old box. The joists are on 16"" centers. I placed and tightened the remodel hanger and even though the old box was tight to the joist and the drywall was partially cut over the joist for the 4 "" hole, this hanger let me install a fan now supported on both sides. Rock solid.I don't understand previous comments about not being able to remove, slide or adjust hanger bracket. I did. If this worked in my 1950''s era home, it should work in yours.I will sleep better now know that the fan is not going to fall on me!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1179,It seems to work well. I enjoy being able to adjust width and length of the spray.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1180,"within a week the ""keeper""to hold it ON while sprinkling broke off and was lost",,,,,,,,,,,,
1181,"Well made, easy to adjust and stays put.And who doesn't like turquoise?",,,,,,,,,,,,
1182,Not a good buy. I  cant accurately  cut the tube in the marking.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1183,"We are both in the senior age range, this toilet seat is high enough that we can sit and stand without hurting our knees. It also flushes and cleans the bowl. For a low water use toilet this is a bonus. I will be ordering a second one for our other bathroom soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1184,"This was a great, convenient & cost effective purchase; just add the connectors, wire & breaker. The box is a little tight for folding of uf cable; but certainly manageable.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1185,Works great! A little more $ than some of the solutions but worth the money. Easy and safe with clean cuts.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1186,VERY lightly used in 1.5 years and garaged when not in use. Plastic body cracked right by where hose connection is and shot water straight into the ground instead of across large area of lawn. Very disappointed but I suppose it's the cheapest option for a reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1187,"I would highly NOT RECOMMEND RING CAMERAS!After several years of working a Ring home alarm and cameras and dealing with antiquated functions and performance, Ring made a bad system even worst with the latest update.The latest ""smart alert"" settings render human detection notification worthless, nada, non-functioning.while it will detect and alert a solo or a group of people walking by it will not alert you or a person's presence if that individual arrived in a vehicle. If delivery personnel parks in front of your house and proceeds to exit the vehicle and drops off the package at your front door RING camera will read it as a ""Motion"", not a ""Person"". this brings me to my dilemma of which I want to be notified if a person enters my yard.After contacting Ring SEVERAL times with my issue and complaints, I was finally told that there is nothing any customer rep and can do other than resetting the camera and function settings or keep making adjustments. I have to deal with it or hope they make a better system and even told once that they understand if I want to change to another brand even though I pay for the yearly Home security and camera cloud storage. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, would have thought better from an Amazon Brand.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1188,Added to my Ring system.  Works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1189,Works very well and has a nice set of options. Doesn't leak at all and does a great job.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1190,It's sharp and works well in tight spots,,,,,,,,,,,,
1191,The flush is weak count on flushing twice,,,,,,,,,,,,
1192,I Bought one two years ago. Loved it so much I bought two more to complete the house. It surprisingly uses very little water. We are both is our 70s and this height is an excellent height for our aging bodies.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1193,Absolutely love it. It adjusts to any size movement you want!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1194,I love the look. It's a bit hard to install but once it's install it made the house look good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,"These backdrop mount clips are great and clip on strong, a little too strong. I mainly use these clips for paper and vinyl backdrops and work just fine. The orange part of the clip is a hard rubbery plastic which I wish it was a little softer for mounting PAPER backdrops, so it won't crease and damage the backdrop. Other than that these are great Lightweight and Sturdy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1196,These work very well in my Craftsman Brad nailer.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,"The nozzles are made much better than many we have purchased at this price through the years. These are metallic and made very well, heavy duty, for long use. The larger nozzle allows you to change the flow of the water strength (top of handle) as well as the water stream type. You can choose flood, mist, shower, flat, jet, center and cone to allow you to have different options depending on what your doing. We have used the settings to clean algae from our dogs pool, wash the cars, water flowers and much more. I definitely recommend this set. It is almost a steal for the price. many made this well are higher priced. Buy these!!See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
1198,Light weight and a good value for your money,,,,,,,,,,,,
1199,Easy to use and very sturdy!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1200,Had to return them because they did not come in the shipment with the new nailer gun.  They showed up three days after I finished my project.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1201,"Matches my other sets I have.  Good price, good quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,Yes this is a great buy works best and it's higher up sit good on it,,,,,,,,,,,,
1203,So far the sprinkler has been great. Easy to adjust pattern andcoverage is great. We will see how long it lasts.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1204,"Been using this model since a year ago, holds up well and surprisingly easy to install.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1205,This is easy to use. It is adjustable as the ends detach if not needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1206,It was what we were looking for and at a good price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1207,"They seem to work ok, very stiff but get the job done",,,,,,,,,,,,
1208,I used these for a woodworking project I did for my daughter. Worked out great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1209,This item is great. Does the job without any  problem.  It is priced very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1210,I can use this clamp as a spreader also and it works great! I am using it to hold my keyboard table out and from sliding back into the computer desk! It performs very well for this application!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1211,Thick cushion so it's comfortable as well as nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1212,It works exactly like it should and seems durable. Only time will tell,,,,,,,,,,,,
1213,Really nice product. We already have 2 installed. They work great,,,,,,,,,,,,
1214,The toilet is wonderful except for the error on the specs: the specs say top of seat to floor is 18.25 in which is why I ordered it . The ACTUAL top of seat to floor is only 17.5 in. :((  What happened to that other 3/4 inch?? Di I get a thin seat?,,,,,,,,,,,,
1215,Replacing our 30 year old ceiling fan and also had to replace box - easy to install - no problem holding 30 lb. fan,,,,,,,,,,,,
1216,Wonderful quality. Fast delivery. I recommend this salesman. Thank youSee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1217,The handle on top of nozzle with control pressure of water made from plastic and started leaking after a month of usage.I would like to return back to Lowes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1218,Love this! It gives me peace of mind while at home and away. I love how I can adjust the zones so it doesn't alert me for unrelated motion.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1219,They seem like a quality tool in their 1st couple of weeks in the field. I like that they have metal handle frames for durability and more difficult cuts. I haven't tried the pipe splitter on the back of the handle but have seen people get hurt attempting to do that with a razor knife.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1220,"If I could return it - I would! The motion sensor is not working at all. The motion sensor activates for every car that drives by but misses whoever is walking their dog and letting it crap in our yard. I've adjusted the sensitivity, the placement of the camera, the angle of the camera, the active fields for the camera - everything I can think of. Still doesn't work. We've already replaced the batteries b/c the camera is recording 150/200 instances of nothing every day. Very disappointed. Again, I would return if I could.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1221,Excellent toilet all the way around! Love the chair height. The oblong bowl has ample room for males. I haven't had a single problem with the low flow flush!I highly recommend this toilet to everyone!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1222,"Unfortunately as with all other lawn sprinklers of this type,the water starts leaking in a serious way from the neck where you attach the hose, after about the 3rd use.  Will be taking 'this back to Lowe's.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1223,This thing is awesome! Everything about it feels like quality product. It stays upright while I drag it all over the yard and through flowerbeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1224,They cut PVC just as expected. What's more to say they just work,,,,,,,,,,,,
1225,"Like, but very expensive",,,,,,,,,,,,
1226,Received on time and happy,,,,,,,,,,,,
1227,"This camera 'hub' has to connect to your home router or camera won't work.  BUT - in 'available networks' WYZE CAM' will show up.Therefore, anyone who lives near you, will be able to see this in available networks.  There is no way to hide it or change the name.What good is a security camera if it's not secure.Also, you agree to let Wyze transfer through the 'hub' connected to your personal router.Makes no sense.  Huge security flaw!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1228,"Bought this in July 2016. Was very happy with it until yesterday. Came home and water on floor due to an 8"" hairline crack running diagonally from handle across the tank. Have read reviews on Lowes and seems that we aren't the only ones that have had this happen to.I have been doing plumbing for over 50 years since I started doing it in the Air Force and as maintenance tech at a church camp, have never had a commode crack like this from normal everyday use. Gave it a four rating due to worked great until this issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1229,Purchased to install privacy fence. Specifically to attach supports to fence poles. Used with my Porter Cable FR350 round head framing nailer. These nails work flawless and had zero misfires.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1230,Worked perfectly!  Excellent product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1231,Great product. Just like description. Haven't used it much. Just received it. Tried it out...no leaks and all the nozzle options worked and sprayed great and pretty far. Great pressure,,,,,,,,,,,,
1232,Works as expectedNailer teeth doesn't work but screws work as a substitute,,,,,,,,,,,,
1233,Better then I expected awsome picture easy install like this camera better then the other ones that cost more I will be getting more camreas,,,,,,,,,,,,
1234,This toilet leaked from day 1. Nothing fixed it. Ended up having to trash it and buy a new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1235,"This nozzle sprayer is easy to use, and fits comfortably in my hand. It switches flow easily.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1236,Worked great as a liner for my planter,,,,,,,,,,,,
1237,These are excellent quality heavy duty spring clamps. The Pony clamps are the best quality of any 1 inch spring clamp I've used.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1238,"for only 20$ to purchase a vise this solid, and of this quality, you couldn't ask for anything more. I expected to pay double for it, but Walmart of course came through to save the day!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1239,"I have bought American Standard for years. I noted in the reviews I read for this one that there had been some comments on ""poor quality"" with cracks, poor finish, leaks and so forth and most seemed to be fairly recent reviews. I hoped that AS produced a bad batch and the problem would be fixed by now. No such luck. On install the tank/bowl interface leaked. I removed the tank, mopped the floor and re-installed the tank to see if I could fix it. I am now removing the toilet so I can return it to Lowes and buy a Kohler. American Standard has lost a customer.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1240,"Beautiful addition to the chairs I purchased at Home Depot to brighten up the common courtyard of my 4-condo quad in Wilmington, NC.  The pattern is very pretty, perfect for a coastal locale.  They are zippered, so I can remove the foam cushioning and wash the covers as needed.  They are not too thick, like tufted versions are, and I feel that's a plus.  They don't raise the height of the seating too much, but they add a little cushioning, and they should dry more quickly than the tufted versions.  They're  new, so have not yet had a chance to endure much weather.  Blazing hot sun and torrential rains are not uncommon here, but for the price, if they last one or two seasons, I'll be happy!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1241,This is the worst Sprayer I've ever bought! It doesn't fit on a hose connection properlySee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1242,I have had three of these in the last 2 years. Their the best Lowe's sells but still only last about 10 months before the start leaking and getting a sticky trigger. I use mine everyday so if you don't it might last longer. I like the heavy construction just wished it held up better to heavy use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1243,"Nice sprayer.  I love all of the spray options. Seems well made, but be sure to remove it before cold weather hits or it will break when it freezes just like any other sprayer will. The manufacture also tells you not use it when the air temperature is below 40 degrees.  I  froze one and bought another because I liked it so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1244,"I had purchased a few other sprinklers from the same manufacturer at Lowes and had great experiences with each. This one was supposed to come with a little tool to adjust the distances, but it didn't which was annoying. The ""power"" was disappointing relative to the others as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1245,It work great. I am an amateur with very little knowledge. Used it to hang up a new fan in an unfinished space,,,,,,,,,,,,
1246,This is the best camera ever for the amount that I paid for,,,,,,,,,,,,
1247,"Love them, they work great and great picture quality",,,,,,,,,,,,
1248,good buy. good price and fast delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1249,"They're nails. They do what they are supposed do, attach one piece of wood to another one. However, these nails work with a nail gun, which is  a well used Paslode model that does what it is supposed to do, which is shoot nails into two pieces of wood to hold them together. So far I haven't has any problems with the nails feeding through the nail gun. So all is good!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1250,there were no instructions in the box I have to have these to get it to work,,,,,,,,,,,,
1251,"Rescreened a screen porch with this material, worked great.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1252,I bought this to hold the blade on my lawnmower while I removed it for sharpening! Worked perfectly and for a great price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1253,"Love the look of this product but it came defective and couldn't use it and to make it more disappointing, they are out of stock and don't know when they'll have be in stock",,,,,,,,,,,,
1254,This was the easiest product to install. When I was finished connecting the camera had great crystal clear pictures the feed is awesome and addicting.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1255,I am very happy with the quality and color of these cushions. They are very comfortable to sit on.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1256,"Very good product, durable and works with other brad nailers.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,Good box worked well for me. Make sure to get the cover that matches the box's screw holes also the right length screws,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,"THIS THING SUCKS ITS HARD TO USE AND ITS SO DARN EXPENSIVE, SHOULD HAVE RETURNED IT THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE EASIER THAN USING THE HAND SAW, ENDED UP USING THE HAND SAW ANYWAYS DO NOT BUY CHEAPER METHODS ARE OUT THERE THAN THIS THING! BBW!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,Work fine but the strips break apart pretty easy handling them. Had to throw out about 10% due to strips breaking up just putting them in my nail gun.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1260,"I love working with PEX. Having one of these cutters in your pouch is way better than dealing with a utility knife. Just a quick snip and you get a nice even cut. I have a cutter from Brass Craft and they are similar, though the Kobalt cutter is a little smaller and lighter. Feels good in your hand and does the job well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1261,This gadget is worth it. I am watering a 6 feet by 7 feet area with it! Works great!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1262,The features are good if you can get them to work right. Customer Service was NOT helpful. Right now it does not pick up people entering my yard just us leaving the house. It picks up every car going down the street. We changed to people only so now it's hit or miss when it picks up anything. Really getting frustrated.,,,,,,,,,,,,

1266,These clamps are very useful for small projects. They have good strength and don't get in the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1267,"I was so pleased with the Cadet 3, I bought 2 more and replaced all the toilets in my house. I needed 2 with 12"" rough in, and one 10"" rough in. They flush amazingly well, easy to clean, very quiet, and refill the tank quickly after each flush. All are 16.5"" tall, and comfortable. I'm very impressed!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1268,Just picked up they look nice and thick but stitching doesn't look like it will last. Also we placed on furniture and sat on them for 5 minutes and already indented and getted discolored. Will be returning!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1269,Bomb-proof and easy to adjust! Awesome purchase!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1270,"Clamp is easy to adjust to the rough width needed.The threaded tightening handle means you can get a solid clamp on the workpiece,and the rubber doesn't mar the surface.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1272,"Great price, useful product, no hassle delivery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1273,Good heavy duty bracket. Easy to install,,,,,,,,,,,,
1274,Comes with everything you need. Easy to adjust to fit pre-existing hole.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1275,"These would cut okay, If they were manufactured correctly. The blade catches to the left side, I was not able to cut things carefully and safely without bending the pipe in a way that would allow the blade to go all the way through. Rather than the blade going through the two prongs, it automatically goes to one side, hitting the metal, so it does not create a clean cut. I was very disappointed, and now I'm going to have to look for something better, so I'm starting to get an understanding why one pair is cheap, and another pair is twice as much...",,,,,,,,,,,,
1276,"easy to use, easy to follow set up instructions. 30 plus clamps crimped and no failures.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1277,Do not buy this. It does not connect directly to a regular garden hose. You have to buy a separate attachment to make it work. Waste of money.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1278,Worked like a charm with my finish nailer,,,,,,,,,,,,
1279,Works as it should a d the image it's clear. It's great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1280,Quality product. They work well in my Ryobi nail gun.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1281,These are an inexpensive option for outdoor furniture. They are not overly plush and I can feel the chair underneath but they look nice and the fabric is easy to wipe clean,,,,,,,,,,,,
1282,"Thought I would spend extra money on a sprinkler for a metal one that would last longer than the plastic ones that never last a season.  My mistake.  First of all, only the frame is metal (not really sure what kind of metal it is - some type of pot metal, magnets don't stick to it), the underside, where the water is piped in, is all plastic. There is a metal coupling that your hose threads into has a thin plastic/rubber ring around it that is supposed to make tightening the coupling to the hose easier.  Except it doesn't.  The plastic ring is just loose around the coupling and within the first day of use immediately was abraded enough on the inner part to make it unusable.  In fact, it made it *more* difficult to tighten or loosen since it just spins around the metal coupling.  Pull that off thinking you can tighten by hand is a mistake also as the outer part of the coupling is closer to jagged serrations than actual an nut head.  Wait! If that is not enough, the coupling does not fit tightly against the inner part of the tubing that goes to the sprinkler, so of course it leaks like a sieve!  Yes I have replaced the inner washers with brand new ones and it made no difference.  Save your money and look elsewhere.  It is simply amazing what companies sell anymore.  The days of quality and value are long gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1283,"I couldn't get it to stop leaking at the hose, and the ""shower"" setting isn't strong enough.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
1284,"Looks nice, operates easy and quiet, and stays remarkably clean.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1285,Color is great but material is thin with a flaw in it and the padding in the cushion is non existant. I will be returning.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1286,Works great in non-bostitch nailers! smooth load and fire. Used these to replace a large fenced in yard!  Came out beautiful and a great time saver!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1287,poor video quality. low bitrate. pixelated faces. not worth the price. CHECK OUT REOLINK.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1288,"No continuous live viewing, no reliable motion detect, just 30 second clips, can go for 10-12 hours without detecting anything when there's clear activity in front of it. No! This is getting sent back.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1289,Love the design and cushions are very comfortable.  They are supportive. Hoping they won't fade.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1290,Great spray positions and the jet makes it string enough like a pressure washer. Love the flip on and off. Nice product. I need 2 more.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1291,Fits in our space perfectly. We have a more narrow space so going with elongated worked best for us. No issues with seat. Everything works well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1292,"Very good quality camera, it's better than expected. Excellent video quality When I found out about the feature that you can hear everything thru it and talk to people I didn't think twice about getting this camera.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1293,The PEX Crimp tool did a terrific job on my pipe joints. It was quick and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1294,It has good force and hence cleans things very efficiently,,,,,,,,,,,,
1295,"I have the two hand pinch tool which I hate and I really wanted this one to work.  I'd give this a 6 out of 10 which is better than the 4 out of 10 for the two hand tool but still this is not a quality tool.  The light works sometimes but not every time.  Maybe 6 times out of 30 clamps.   The instructions say to NOT ratchet more than 7 times BUT it takes 3 or 4 ratchets just to reach the clamp.. so do you count from 3 for 7 for 10 in total or from 4 for 7 for a total of 11.. or do you just keep squeezing until the light comes on BUT that only happens sometimes.  AND if you weren't sure if you are on 10 or 11 and try one more squeeze the tool doesn't release when you twist the release knob.  I did a medium sized project with just under 30 clamps and 3 out of the 30 left the tool hanging on the pipe.  Would try squeezing even harder while trying to turn the release knob, smacking it with a screw driver and at one point thought about how to disassemble the tool while it was stuck hanging from the pipe.  As much as it gave me problems it was MUCH EASIER to use than the two hand tool.  Wish there was a better quality version of this tool.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1296,This cushion seems well constructed and is for a very sunny spot so Sunbrella fabric is a must. It has a zipper enclosure so good for cleaning or changing out.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1297,"Again it fit glider perfect with a red pop of color, love it!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1298,Seems like good material but Def not water proof or water resistant. It barely rained and it took days with a fan and sun to dry inside? It's a giant sponge. Not comfortable and missing half the order?,,,,,,,,,,,,
1299,I was looking for these clamps to install some drawer fronts. Great price and good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,
1300,These finish nails don't hang in the nail gun. But there hold good in the finish materials.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1301,"This is a really nice product that is reasonable to install and looks great on my floor. I pulled low voltage speaker wire through the floor, so cut away everything to use only the brass plate.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1302,"I used these to redo the shingle on the weather end of my house, which had rotted from behind due to a quick and dirty window replacement by a previous owner that let water into the wall. They fit my nailgun fine, only jammed once in a week of working, and seem to be holding up well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1303,"Easy to use, high quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1304,good product but expensive may not buy them as often as i would like due to the price,,,,,,,,,,,,
1305,This is a cheaply made hunk of plastic . Dont waste your time or money on this garbageSee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1306,"This is not the most beefy of clamp, I got a lot of flex on the bar when I was using it, but for the price it was perfect for my light duty job. I was repairing a 100 year old board and batten interior door that had separated at the top. I used two and left them on for a few days with the door laying on sawhorses to let the wood relax back into shape. After stripping off 6 layers of paint. I placed one at the top and one midway down the door and tightened them over a period of time.  It worked out wonderfully, and the clamps are a piece of cake to store for later use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1307,Very nice and comfortable. I can sit and get up without my knees hurting.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1308,"Works great, the lights were brighter than I thought it would. Very clear video. 100% recommended. Easy installation",,,,,,,,,,,,
1309,The metal base makes it more stable and durable. The metal coupling for the hose makes it more durable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1310,Excellent fits perfect works great,,,,,,,,,,,,
1311,My bay window uses a lever to open the side panels with a catch half-way up the window frame. I'm not very handy so I just tacked screening on. Years later I found this magnetic screen so I bought 1 to try out. It was so easy to install even I was able to do it! So I bought a second screen and now have a very nice bay window. The instructions are great and there is plenty of material to work with. The screen lifts open easily to open the window and then holds tightly closed to prevent flies.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1312,"Love this little camera! Great picture quality, connecting was super easy, and every time someone goes through the room, the app buzzes tour phone and records a sniping of the activity. You can also speak to that person and go live to watch the room. Awesome product.. I am buying 4 more for every room!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1313,The cushions went flat immediately and not comfortable to sit on. I wished I would have bought something else. so dissappointed,,,,,,,,,,,,
1314,They fit the ryobi nail gun perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,
1315,Best sprinkler ever. Totally adjustable. I bought if for my narrow side yard. It's about 8 ft and it still has two narrower settings. And the pressure setting is great. No going back to the faucet to lower the distance the water goes. I ordered the one with the base and got the one with the stake. But l think I like it just as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1316,"It's small, and fits perfect on the corner 9f my work bench. Don't expect to he pounding out flat steel on the 1"" anvil or to to be hammering out pipe with it. but for a garage use vise, it works well",,,,,,,,,,,,
1317,Good quality. Easy to install!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1318,Easy to use and all the tools needed to replace a torn screen on a sliding door.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1319,Love. Love. Love. Haven't had them long but I built a table and they were paramount in making it happen. Definitely will keep them close for all my projects.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1320,"Very easy to set up and get running.  The relay however, is a bit slow; usually 45-60 seconds.  A minute could be a very long time in a bad situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1321,I purchased 6 sets.  Color was spot on...very well made....soft comfortable fabric. We love this product!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1322,Easy install. Fits perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1323,Using it to monitor construction modification while U'm away fir 6 months.  Working great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1324,good price fast shipping good deal,,,,,,,,,,,,
1325,Stop making the toilet smaller and label the height on the toilet.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1326,I ordered three different sizes. The size shown above in the photo was damaged when it arrived. The package was broken open and a lot of the nails were broken apart.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1327,"Had this tool for about 6 months and finally got the time to use it this week. It worked great right out of the package until I got to about my 4th fitting to crimp. The pawl for the ratchet stopped engaging so squeezing the handles did nothing anymore. I ended up having to squeeze with one hand and use my other hand to constantly hold tension against the release lever as the internal return spring is too weak to do it on its own. If I released even the slightest bit of resistance on the lever, the tool would pop wide open and lose any grip it had on the fitting. I might take it apart and try to swap out the stretched spring for something more robust. If that one part worked as intended this would be a near perfect tool, but as it stands it is nearly useless.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1328,"easy set-up, works great!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1329,"I purchased this sprinkler, understanding I probably wouldn't get the advertised 4500 sq ft of coverage, but hoping for the best.  I measure 55 gph at my outside faucet and the sprinkler only covered about 300 sq ft!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1330,"Great cushions, fast delivery...thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1331,"These clamps are very easy to use,  will recomend, very nice for the price",,,,,,,,,,,,
1332,These are pretty nice clamps for the money. The only thing is the piece of plastic on the end comes off with pressure or it might just fall off by itself. That needs to be improved Irwin Co.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1333,Good quality C clamps.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1334,Easy to set up and always works great,,,,,,,,,,,,
1335,"After two years of searching for well-made and affordable cushions, I finally decided to give these a shot. They defenitly exceded my expectations! They are thick, comfortable, and look a lot more expensive in person. I would 10/10 recommend!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1336,Okay spray nozzle for the money. I had to put another washer in it the original leaked.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1337,"Awesome! Makes it a lot easier to wash my car, or water the plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1338,"The entire sprinkler is metal so very robust. The controls for length of spray are the usual and easy. Cute feature is controls to shut of left, centre, or right independently. It lies flat on the ground and stays where you put it because the weight of the metal keeps it from flipping when you turn on the hose. Water shut off valve is great to let you pick up the sprinkler, turn on the water, place the sprinkler where you want, turn off the shut-off valve and go do something else; you don't have to walk back to the faucet.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1339,I love the Ring Peephole! It's easy to install and is perfect for apartment living. It's small and discreet. Would definitely recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1340,Pads over c clamp and easy to use.Great clamps!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1341,Easy to install and worked great. Would definitely recommend to anyone installing a ceiling fan or light fixture of up to 70lbs,,,,,,,,,,,,
1342,They fit the nailer perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1343,Good quality screen nice to work with .,,,,,,,,,,,,
1344,Only complaint is the price.  Worked great in my Paslode gun,,,,,,,,,,,,
1345,This is wide and thick. Bigger than my chair. I will get a new one. I was really surprised to see such great quality and comfortable.  This is around 7 inches thick. And can attach together,,,,,,,,,,,,
1346,Jet spray mode is weak others are fine,,,,,,,,,,,,
1347,Very easy to use. Comes with all proper tools and instructions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1348,Not overly complicated to setup.  Covers my property like I wanted.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1349,Can you get nails on great I bought a pack of the Porter-Cable nails and Brad nailers I have an old HDX Home Depot brand nailers and they work fine in there and secured my wood projects  I needed. To do,,,,,,,,,,,,
1350,Love the fact I can change the spray pattern and 2nd hose hookup.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1351,I used these to attach deck railings in redwood that is prone to split and these worked great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1352,I highly recommend this sprinkler. Having the ability to adjust the flow and the angle of the sprinkler is invaluable. On each end you can change the angle or the distance the sprinklers sprays right/left. This allowed me to focus more on my lawn and not unnecessary water on sidewalks or side of the house. I'll even throw in your neighbors lawn. I'm able to give my lawn more water in lesser time by using these features because I am not wasting water on my side walk or side of my house laterally. I say do it 100%!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1353,"Great replacement screen for sliding screen door or screen windows. Easy to see out of, easy install. Make sure you get the one that comes with the install tool as it is way easier than without it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1354,We like it very much.  I didn't realize the attachments didn't come with it so we had to buy them extra.  Works very well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1355,Excellent recommend it,,,,,,,,,,,,
1356,Excellent camera for the price!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1357,Product was as described and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1358,"solid construction, doesn't leak, good value. Should last a good long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1359,"Tested the crimp on 3/4"" and 1/2"" pex with copper rings. The 1/2"" was fine, but the 3/4"" was uneven. The gauge showed over-crimped on one part of the ring and under-crimped when I rotated the ring 90 deg. Wasted four crimp rings with this bad tool.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1360,"Good working size box, no problems with any of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1361,Looks like a good idea but do not clampfirmly enough to be useful to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1362,Includes everything you need to fix a screen door. Easy to use - will likely have to purchase again in the future,,,,,,,,,,,,
1363,This was first time installing a fan and this brace made it easy. I am not confident in handling such task. Good solid construction and firm grip on the joists. Will buy again if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1364,"I purchased two Champion 4 toilets about 3-years ago and I like them so much that I bought another for my mountain cabin.  I like the seating height of 16.5-inches, the elongated bowl and they always flush completely with less water than my previous toilets.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1365,Worked excellent for my fence project. Had some jams every now and then at end of strip before next fed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1366,"I bought two Stick Up battery powered Ring security cameras. The quality of the video is fantastic, but that's the only thing good I can say. I needed these to work as security cameras as the advertised range to pick up motion is 30 feet. I tested both cameras and neither work beyond 10 feet. I never installed them and read all the literature from Ring about not putting them too high so I used a test height of 4 and 6 feet and got similar results from both heights. After spending time with ...",,,,,,,,,,,,
1367,"Excellent for our narrow side yard, which I had previously had to hand water. The yard is on a slight incline, so I propped up one side of the sprinkler and it worked perfectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1368,Cost was my determining factor. Quality was excellent. Remodeling a second home.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1369,The screen repair was easy to complete but there isn't enough spline for more than 2 28 inch square screens.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1370,Perfect crimpers ive used them on several jobs and they worked great,,,,,,,,,,,,
1371,"I've never bought screen mesh and repaired my own screen before so I don't have other products to compare this too. I can however compare this screen mesh to the mesh that I just replaced and it is much thicker and feels very sturdy. We have two cats that love sitting in the windows and the quality of this screen makes me feel secure. As far as instillation goes, it is quite thick so I used that roller tool to push the screen mesh into the grooves before I pushed the tubing in. It was impossible to push the tubing in without doing that first. It was a challenge, and my hand hurt in the end but the new screen looks great. One thing I also want to mention is the visibility. It is definitely a bit harder to see through this screen. The mesh is tighter and thicker which reduces visibility a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1372,Terrible quality. Blade broke on 3rd cut.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1373,"Can't say much on longevity since it's pretty new, but it works great. Time will tell how it works with our very hard water. This is exactly what I needed for occasional use to water small plants and bushes. I bought a second one to use for washing the car from a second hose.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1374,"It's ok if it work perfectly. Otherwise the part that makes it rotate can come lose or be in the wrong position, and you are watering straight down, instead of in the air. I want paying attention for a few minutes and caught it. Glad I was paying attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1375,I have no idea why this sprinkler claims to cover 700 sq ftâ€”I can only get it to spray about four feet in any direction.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1376,"Very sharp, makes clean cuts on 3/4 pvc. I've how easy it is to latch the handle once I am finished using it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1377,"Offline 50% of the time. Have to click ""continue"" every 30 seconds to continuously stream. So frustrating. We purchased to use, potentially, as a baby monitor. Do not recommend for that purpose at all. Or for anything you want to live view/stream. Picture quality is great, but everything else sucks.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1378,"Thought I was upgrading to a better nozzle. Bought one and it worked great so I bought three others, one for each of my hoses. Within months, three out of four are broken, due to the cheap plastic shut-off lever that snapped off. The nozzle itself is great. The lever should also be metal.  I would look for another nozzle than this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1379,Bright colors! Very pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,
1380,"came as described, seems to work well so far. would order again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1381,I bought 2 sprinklers at the same time and both failed 3.5 months after purchase with only 2.5 months of use!I will not buy again. Purchased 6/11/19 Failed 9/30/19,,,,,,,,,,,,
1382,"Definitely love the outdoor camera! However my flaw about it is that the motion Detector does not give my phone a notification until after the fact of someone being on my porch. I feel like in the spot it's at it should be alarming me when they are walking up to the door. As well as when cars pull in and put, sometimes it can detect a bus driving by the house but not at my front door. I currently have Wyze everything in my house from the light bulbs to the cameras indoor and out, and they are all connected to my Alexa and they are great by all other means.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1383,"Can use it one handed. This cutter is better than any of the previous PEX/PVC cutters I have owned. The compact size that makes using it in tight places must easier. Cuts PEX, PVC and rubber hose with ease. Thick walled PVC may require both hands but it will still leave a nice clean cut.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1384,perfect for crown moulding! best price and strong holds everytime. These are my go to finish nails.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1385,They were easy to install and are working great!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1386,Never saw one like this. Easy to use with perfect results.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1387,Perfect replacement and easy install. Highly recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1388,"Durable screen, used it for all of my windows upstairs. Much better than the fiberglass screen. The birds kept picking out the fiberglass screens on my windows every year, now with the aluminum screen they haven't picked on it so far. Tricky at first trying to put the screen on the frame, but got the hang of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1389,"You can never have too many clamps.  They are easy to use and have adequate strength.  I like the fact that the clamps are designed to link together increasing the overall length.  However, when the clamps are linked, you cannot go full force because the joint bows and the clamps pull apart.  Other than that, these clamps are an excellent choice for all projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1390,Great height and work 100 times better than my old toilet.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1391,"I have replaced about 6 different of my old toilets in 2 different homes with these toilets from Kohler. They are easy to install, and have had not had any issues with them for over 2+ years of use. I would recommend them.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1392,"This 4 pact of bar clamps is of good qualilty, built to last.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1393,"I purchased the Melnor 4500 at Lowes and it set in my garage for a couple of weeks.  When I was ready to use it the 'end plug cleaning tool' was no where to be found.   What a poor design.  Without the cap water just runs out the end.  So, I guess Melnor & Lowes made a few bucks and I got tricked.  Geeez!Also, you can't buy an end cap.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1394,"This toilet is an amazing deal. It looks beautiful and comes with everything needed for installation, except for the water supply line (which should already be there if replacing an existing toilet). Installation is quick and easy with many of the parts already preassembled. I also own Kohler and Toto toilets, but the Glacier Bay holds its own compared to them!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1395,"I bought 4 of these for my yard. Within 3 days, 2 out of the 4 have broken. They stop spraying back and forth. It just gets stuck in one spot. I'd say spend a little extra money to buy a better one. This one isn't worth a penny.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1396,Good strong metal box.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1397,"Love this sprinkler. Easy to use, offers several connection options, and does a great job on my lawn. Ordered two! Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1398,"GOOD QUALITY, EASY TO INSTALL",,,,,,,,,,,,
1399,Love the quality and the color,,,,,,,,,,,,
1400,"All of the 1/2"" tubing was missing from the box!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1401,"Good quality brad nail, been using them on my Rigid nailer without a single jam so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1402,Great tool made my life alot Easier and got the job done in an efficient amount of time. Price was worth it!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1403,Best cushions for the money.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1404,"Good camera for price tag, highly recommend this indoor camera.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1405,I liked the material & ease of installment.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1406,"Easy to use. While the pictures make the jaws look shorter, they aren't. it's really because the jaw pads are wider. Every bit as good as previous iteration. Slightly better even. So handy for one-hander use!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1407,"This Gilmour rotating sprinkler operates well in a fairly simple design. Only waters a circular pattern, but, with non-linear landscape that is NOT a hindrance. It puts a good, solid soaking on my lawn and is good quality material.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1408,I've had yi and now a kami cameras for a while now. Have always been annoyed with the amount of advertising on the app. Now they've updated the app to take away standard functionality like video playback longer than 6 seconds. Now I need to find an alternative. Do not buy this product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1409,"The company sent a private message to me saying to not give them a bad review and they will compensate for a good review. This product is defective and definitely not usable in any way. The ""screen"" is a piece of thin window curtain with holes big enough for any bug and insect to crawl through, the packaging, instruction paper, and other pieces altogether look like a sad scam from China. What a freaking waste of time. Do better",,,,,,,,,,,,
1410,"Not one misfire. I figured I'd give the Dewalt nails a shot in my NR83 Hitachi. Worked perfect with no misaligned nails therefore, no misfires.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1411,"Even worth washer in,  the handle continually leaks.  Don't bother.  I'll be throwing them away.  I bought two of them :(",,,,,,,,,,,,
1412,They worked just like brad nails are supposed to work. Held trim to wall beautifully.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1413,"It's an excellent product for the given price. Night vision camera is not as effective. Also speaker has some distortion. Can make two way convo easily. Has lots of cool features - motion detection, sound detection etc. Can't be accessed from other regions. Picture quality is not as sharp even in HD mode but pretty decent. 3.75 would be my rating. Better products available but at four times the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1414,great sprinkler.  Covers large areas.  Once you get the adjustments done its great!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1415,They worked perfectly for me. No issue at all,,,,,,,,,,,,
1416,This sprinkler works good and covers a good size area and is adjustable. The only thing I don't like is where you hook the hose. It doesn't seal well and leaks at the connection,,,,,,,,,,,,
1417,It broke the first time I used it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1418,Nails worked great. Installed stair treds in minutes. Solid and squeak free,,,,,,,,,,,,
1419,they are just what i wanted. only problem is one of the cameras stopped working,,,,,,,,,,,,
1420,Pretty much perfect for my purposes and such a good price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1421,Simple to use. Good clamping pressure for small to medium size projects. Easy to orient for best clamping pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1422,Works good holds what it's needs to.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1423,Amazing ! The best !!! Totally recommend this if you have a pet and want tearfear,,,,,,,,,,,,
1424,Nice little clamps worked great for a furniture repair. Very sturdy and well made.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1425,The brace easy to install. Great design. Best brace so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1426,I like the fact that it has multiple settings,,,,,,,,,,,,
1427,So easy to replace screens with this product!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1428,It's a great clamp to help you . It really works so good to hold something in place like example my bed broke and I use this clamp to re-glue and hold it can I have a pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,
1429,Easy to use. It definitely beats the hack saw I was using to cut the sprinkler risers.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1430,"I like that there were several colors. The grey I got was perfect, not too dark or light. The pads are comfortable on the bottom but, because they don't come up high enough on the back, they not only look short, they provide no support to the shoulders. I would send all 6 back but how would I ever get them rolled up again and stuffed in a box?! They feel like they have air in them...just...odd.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1431,They very easy to install and the product is very clear,,,,,,,,,,,,
1432,"Omg! Who knew replacing my window screens could be so simple? I always thought installing new screens was a task and I was honestly ready to take my window screen frames to my local hardware store for them to do the work. Instead I ordered this kit thinking ok I'll give it a shot. So glad I did! Easy to use, durable material (I was worried it would be flimsy) and the handy dandy tool just took the cake!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1433,"I love the wireless Blink. It's Very easy to setup, link, and install, both physically and on the app. We have two set up over 50 feet from the Blink router as well as our router. The live view works everytime. The only drawback might the night vision if it is near a light source. Otherwise it's been two months and no complaints.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1434,"Tool worked very well, no leaks!  However, I will say that the 1"" clamps are extremely tough to close.  The small lever did help me get it started and locked onto clamp, but beyond that the final closure was tough.  I ended up using a bar clamp to close the tool because I didn't have anything to extend the handles. Whew, thankfully the SharkBite tool is strong and well built.  I would suggest that SharkBite include handle extensions or if not the consumer should purchase two pipe nipples to fit over handles to make them longer when needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1435,Reasonable price and nice 2 clamps can be combined,,,,,,,,,,,,
1436,"Video quality is excellent, app is easy to use. able to View on nest hub is a huge plus.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1437,"I cannot figure out how this works! The three-star rating is for the design and expected durability of the nozzle settings. The dial turns and clicks into position securely. Here is my frustration: How on earth do I attach this device to my hose? I am in the process of returning this, having ordered instead the old-fashioned brass hand-adjustable model. I want to like this but just cannot figure it out. I fault myself rather than the product. Since, however, there were no instructions or diagrams shipped with the nozzle, I still cannot determine how to properly attach it to my hose.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
1438,This was the cheapest thinnest thing I've ever seen a total waste of money,,,,,,,,,,,,
1439,"This clamps are awesome.I make frames and I am very impressed by the quality and strength, easy to handle for women's hands.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1440,Perfect ceiling fan box - installed 2x6 support in attic/ceiling and the rest was a breeze.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1441,"Moved to a combo of SharkBites and PEX for our recent bathroom remodel. Both are SO MUCH EASIER than trying to solder wet pipes. Pros may have tricks to make that work...but I only have two days in a weekend to get as much stuff done as possible!These worked very well for making PEX connections using the metal band clamps. Tool is plenty sturdy for the 10-20 connections I will make in my lifetime, and was about a third of the cost of one from the big box store.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1442,"Clamps work excellent. Easy to use, high quality tools. Short clamps exactly fills the gaps in my woodworking tool arsenal.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1443,"I installed one in my workshop so I wouldn't have power cables hanging from the ceiling. Installs pretty easily, but be precise when you cut the hole in the floor. The tolerances for the cover and the mounting ""ears"" are pretty tight. I got the hole just a bit too big and had to drill thru one of the mounting ears to get the cover mounted to the floor. The other con, although not significant is that with some plugs, especially those with a hefty stress relief on them, you may not be able to fully close the dust cover. That said, it's been a good addition to my shop to help with wire management.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1444,"It worked great for about 10 cuts, then it started failing. Made from thin plastic, it has ""cheap"" written all over it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1445,Broke the first time we used it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1446,The clips are great but the feet that spread out the pressure on the surface they clip to pop off all the time. They just do no stay on and without them the clips leave marks.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1447,Value for the money. Used on a dog house,,,,,,,,,,,,
1448,Worked well. Easy install for remodel.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1449,Perfect box for new or old work!Very sturdy! Has everything included.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1450,This sprayer works really well! I had bought one of those fancy plastic ones a few years ago and it didn't spray as well as this one and it eventually started to leak. I bought this one from the store and I wasn't sure what the threading at the tip was for until reading 'about item' online. That's great! Idk if Walmart sells attachment pieces for washing cars but I will checkSee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1451,This was my first time buying a toilet. I told them I wanted something taller than my current toilet but didn't realize I needed to specify an elongated seat. The display toilets are up high so I couldn't tell the difference. I just liked the dual flush feature. This seat is so small that I'm afraid to go #2 because it will get on the back of the seat and not into the toilet. This design is more for children not adults. I'm really disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1452,"Great little camera, quality images daytime at night some degradation. Easy to move around my home.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1453,"Sturdy, well made product.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1454,They worked great in my brad nailer,,,,,,,,,,,,
1455,"First of all the toilet seat never stays up, a bad design and a frustration but we've dealt with it. Today, about a year after installing, the tank cracked and leaked. Thankfully I was home to catch it before the water got out of the bathroom.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1456,Highly recommend! Patio perfection!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1457,"These are super nice, prob 3-4 inches thick. They didn't fade. They didn't mold. Def can keep using season after season.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1458,"Love it, very solid product, wish it came in green or black.Works great",,,,,,,,,,,,
1459,Love this cushion! Love the color. Very comfortable and well made.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1460,This a excellent toilet for tall and elderly people.  The flushing is very good,,,,,,,,,,,,
1461,Works excellent. Does not mar the fitting,,,,,,,,,,,,
1462,Using to clamp long boards in position for fastening together. Work well. Will likely buy a few more.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1463,If you want to install a heavy light fixture or ceiling fan while remodeling this will save you a lot of time. Easy to install and uses standard household wiring. If you are replacing an existing fixture be sure your wiring is up to code. Some fans require 20 amp and or a dedicated circuit in some regions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1464,Poor quality picture... Ended up purchasing RING from Home Depot,,,,,,,,,,,,
1465,"The long spray head came off with the first use. I tried to screw it back on, it was impossible simply because it's a push on head. The water pressure it too much for this poorly made nozzle. A mortal flawSee more",,,,,,,,,,,,
1466,"The only complaints I have is two: They do not report directly to a home monitoring system, and sometimes it doesn't pick up motion. They are great bang for your buck however and overall I'd give blink cameras an 8/10.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1467,"are the reasons I bought one. Upon using it, I went back and bought another. Easy to operate, does it all +, nice and sturdy, and the value can't be beat. Highly recommend!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1468,"The plastic range adjustment sliders stopped functioning on the second use. The sprinkler just moves the stops when the rotational head bumps into them. Maybe I got a dud, but I imagine this is the first part to fails for most people.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1469,This is perfect for high traffic areas in your home so you don't have to keep opening and closing doors. Kids and pets go in and out easily. The magnetic door always goes back in place and is strong.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1470,They did a great job on going in without any problems,,,,,,,,,,,,
1471,Easy to install for someone with no skill as handy person.,,,,,,,,,,,,

1474,Eye popping colors. Excellent fabric,,,,,,,,,,,,
1475,"The flush is good and it uses a minimum of water, however it is rather low to the ground and it does not fit up next to the wall as the one it replaced would do.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1476,Good product! Worked well in my Ridgid gun.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1477,It's easy to set the direction of the water flow however the height and length of the as it comes out leaves a lot to the imagination. Compared to my neighbors sprinkler that has a full flow and cover his entire yard this sprinkler does just that send out a sprinkle of water so I have to water one section then move it to water another section. My yard isn't that big and it wont cover the entire yard.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1478,Very good clamp at a very good price,,,,,,,,,,,,
1479,Works great! Easy to set up and view in app. Only improvement would be longer recording time span vs many short clips.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1480,"Pretty hunter green, very waterproof ðŸ¤ ",,,,,,,,,,,,
1481,Good quality nozzle to use for pretty much anything around the outside of the house. Has a fairly long stream and has good adjustments. Seems well made. I have been happy with mine since I bought it. I couldn't seem to find a good nozzle without them leaking or falling apart.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1482,"It does work, but poorly and is difficult to get a flush cut. It tends to spiral around the pex, then you have to clean up the cut with a utility knife. For $5 more, get this: https://www.lowes.com/pd/IRWIN-1-5-in-Multipurpose-Pipe-Cutter/1000666407, which works like a dream.This is going back to the store today.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1483,First time I used the biggest clamp it broke. It wasn't under undue pressure so a bit disappointed. Other ones used so far are ok,,,,,,,,,,,,
1484,Camera cuts off at night which is when I need it to work the most??,,,,,,,,,,,,
1485,The nailer is light weight and so easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1486,"It's working fine. I would have liked to see a few more spikes in the ends, but I trust our regulations that it holds a 75lb fan. Its working fine, and it was very easy to install.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1487,"I used this for 1"" pvc sprinkler pipe outside during the ""Great Texas freeze of 2021"" it worked perfectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1488,Works great and clamps very powerful.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1489,Great Fabric and cushion confit,,,,,,,,,,,,
1490,"I was a little worried about not having a trigger pull, but the thumb feature is better than I thought. This made my water pressure 2x stronger. I'd buy it again. Plus my 6-year-old daughter picked it out so I knew it would be good.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1491,This junction box a was the right fit for area I was developing in to a bathroom very well put together.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1492,Perfect!  Color are rich and padding  are just the Right firmness.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1493,"Would not cut butter without crushing it, much less PEX. I would through it away if I could not return it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1494,Heavy DutyGood variety of patternsMuch better flow than the old one I replaced,,,,,,,,,,,,
1495,"I bought one of these two years ago to replace an expensive Toto toilet, it worked perfectly while my other two Totos continued to malfunction and require expensive parts and labor. Bought two more a couple weeks ago and threw the last two Totos to the curb where they belong!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1496,Works well. Wish it was a bit heavier but it's still works well,,,,,,,,,,,,
1497,it is solid and not all plastic,,,,,,,,,,,,
1498,"Cool little sprinkler. Throws a nice, big pattern. Bought two but may buy more. Lightweight.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1499,Screen came in perfect condition and packaged in protective cardboard tube.Exactly what I was looking for.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1500,Works perfect in my Ryobi pin nailer,,,,,,,,,,,,
1501,Did the job and was shipped very well,,,,,,,,,,,,
1502,GOOD EASY TO WORK WITH. IF I DID IT AGAIN - I MAY GO WITH A SMALL OPENNING INSECT SCREEN AS I HAVE A LOT OF NO SEE UMS AND GNATS IN MY AREA. THE BLACK IT IS A LITTLE DARK - BUT WORKS FOR ME AS I HAVE ALOT OF SUN COMING IN.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1503,Beautiful and comfy!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1504,"Spend the money on better, the material makes them sleek that the back cushion is always sliding and the foam in the part you sit on is crap.. they look nice but definitely would not buy again..",,,,,,,,,,,,
1505,"Great, strong nails, smooth firing",,,,,,,,,,,,
1506,"Was so easy to use, my 8 year old son completed the job!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1507,"These screens are cheap and not meant to last even through the summer. The screens rip easily and unless you're careful, the screen will split into two pieces and it's hard to put them together again. Too bad American industry gave up on making affordable window screens. As cheap as these are, they aren't worth the time or a dime.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1508,Ease of use and set up,,,,,,,,,,,,
1509,Fit and work with no jams.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1510,"By far, my favorite tool for PEX.  Easy to use and reliable.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1511,Love this camera. Itâ€™s got everything at a great price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1512,It's too wabbly and the blade dulled the first time I used it. It's cheap Chinese made poop,,,,,,,,,,,,
1513,Handles are kind of short so you need some strength to use these. I had to have my husband crimp them after everything was put together,,,,,,,,,,,,
1514,"The nails fit perfect, don't bend when inserted in to the boards from the nail gun.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1515,Useless thing!! get any ratcheting cutter instead for cleaner and straight cuts,,,,,,,,,,,,
1516,This product is easy to install and very sturdy. I highly recommend it if you need to install either a ceiling fan or light.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1517,"Like many impact sprinklers, this version has adjustments for distance, spray, and diameter. All are easily set. The 6"" long aluminum stake will provide good stabilization when inserted fully in the ground. A flow thru hose connection allows ""daisy-chaining"" of several units together. In the Texas heat, the plastic cap might end up cracking, so I would suggest replacing it with a metal cap if you are not daisy-chaining other units. As with all sprinklers, the settings for distance will be determined by the amount of water pressure at your home. Lower water pressure equals less distance. This sprinkler is rated at 82 feet.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
1518,"It was as expected, nice bright colors, looks really nice",,,,,,,,,,,,
1519,Easy to use and install,,,,,,,,,,,,
1520,This trigger clamp was the perfect tool to help me fix a broken kitchen drawer. I would definitely recommend this for any small repairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1521,"There's a reason this tool has such good reviews. It's far cheaper that similar tools, super easy to use with the ratcheting safety that doesn't allow you to back off on the crimp halfway. Works super slick and easy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1522,Product works just like it should,,,,,,,,,,,,
1523,"Works great, supports the fan well",,,,,,,,,,,,
1524,"Looked everywhere for a new ""in the floor"" outlet that was black or silver to go with our new carpet. Finally found this one at Lowe's. Had to cut some of the floorboard and carpet for the box to fit, but my husband did it without a problem. Looks great installed!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1525,"Horrible, only one spray option. A waste of money.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
1526,"So far they have been comfortable, but time will tell how they hold up over the summer",,,,,,,,,,,,
1527,Came on time and nozzle is high quality and still going strong than the others that I have bought. Highly recommend for home gardening or if you just need a good nozzle. This one I highly recommend! Love itSee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1528,Finally a sprinkler that's durable and works well,,,,,,,,,,,,
1529,stronger that less expensive alternative,,,,,,,,,,,,
1530,"Worked fine, as advertised, no leaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1531,Looks great when install is finished,,,,,,,,,,,,
1532,Works good if you want something small so it doesn't take up room.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1533,Good tool but not really easy to use one handed in awkward spaces.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1534,"I bought this toilet because I loved the look and the idea of the powerful flush.  I paid almost $400.  Installed this toilet in 2016.  Have had nothing but problems!  At least twice, the AS customer service has sent me a replacement universal inlet valve, which is the main part of the flushing system.  The lady I spoke with really couldn't diagnose the problem and was quick to send that part both times.  I'm still having the same problem with water draining into the bowl and the tank keeps refilling.  Googled it and it turns out it is the seal that is on the bottom of the actual flappers.  Reviews make it sound like it will be an ongoing problem and that this whole thing is a bad design.  The other night, it wouldn't even flush but that got better.  Please Google this toilet and others with the dual flaps before you purchase.  BIG mistake on my part.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1535,"Melnor Pulsator Sprinkler with Zinc 2-Way Spikes (2-Pack), works great with municipal water supplywith good water pressure. It may be a little less efficient with well water pressure. Otherwise, it's a great value and works well.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1537,"No airs about it, these finished the job and really nailed it!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1538,"Ordered this Gilmour brand nozzle Jun 27, 2020. Delivered it only a few days. First used it a about a week later. The third time I used it was a few months later, when it broke at the top if the threads. Needless to say, it was a bug disappointment. Used this type of nozzle very often for heavy commercial use for years, with no problem. But this brand was a waste of time and money. Won't by anything by this brand ever again!DislikesConstructionSee more",,,,,,,,,,,,
1539,Don't waste your money on this nozzle!! A regular adjustable garden nozzle has a stronger sprayer and will do a better job than this!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1540,These nails do the job just as you would expect. Work great in my Brad nailer!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1541,"After just a couple uses, the seats and pillows are flattened and don't hold their shape. I wouldn't recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1542,"It IS sharp !!  Just the tool I have needed, and saw my fellow associate with his, and bought mine later the same day.  Easy to use and performs well; no pressure in its function, whereas before, I could never cut Pex with ease.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1543,Item does not look like picture. Unclear instructions on how to adjust spray,,,,,,,,,,,,
1544,Easy to assemble,,,,,,,,,,,,
1545,"Ok this is crazy. So all this time I thought that once you have a ring camera its all yours, you have your own personal camera for your home. Little did I know you still have to pay monthly subscription for it, if you don't you cant see any videos it captured before, you can only watch live footage! So lets say someone stole something or someone came to your front door. It wont let you see the video it captured so once you go live that person is gone! So lets say someone stole something you have no video evidence to prove that person stole something from your yard. This is ridiculous, not sure why its $200 but yet you have yo pay a subscription. It's completely pointless and defeats the purpose. You are better off buying a cheaper camera that doesn't have a subscription.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1546,"Got this 4 pack on sale for $16. I'm not a wood worker by trade but I've needed more than one of these clamps numerous times. These ""newer"" style of Irwin clamps do have a bolt holding the end clamping arm. I have an older Irwin brand that has a completely molded end so not sure if it was riveted then molded over before but these are a little different manufacture style. I'm not saying they are not as strong but do be aware these are different. The sizes are exactly the same and they worked just a well as my old one. I was recommended these over cheaper and over more expensive brands. For the price on sale they are hard to beat.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1547,"As with the Ring Doorbellâ€¦ I like that I know when someone is at my door and can see them, but if it picks up motion further out, you can't enlarge the picture to make out who it is coming in and out in my nearby unattached garage. it gets too grainy and blurry.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1548,I buy all Orbit sprinklers and timers.  This one is JUNK.  The female end falls off and you put it back on and it falls off again.  The gear drive part of it is awesome.  The base is such poor quality!Don't buy!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1549,"Poor quality sprays There are three pieces in a package. That is the only good selling point. No sooner did I attached the wand spray and turned the water spigot on, spray head came off the rest of the wand and flew off and landed in bushes. After discovering it back, I reattached it to the rod and tightened it; However, it came apart again and flew off. In a nutshell, it is a poorly assembled piece of equipment and not worth it.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,

1552,"I bought these at the end of the season last year and we sat on them three times before storing them for the winter. The seat part of the cushion was already breaking down.  We got them out recently for a couple of nice April days here in Michigan. After just a couple more sittings they are completely broke down. I mean, you can feel the metal slats of the chair frame when you sit and there are big intentions on every seat cushion.  The back cushions won't even sit on the chair any more.  My husband weighs 135 lbs. and I weigh 120 lbs., so we are not big people.  Lowes won't stand behind the products they sell and their answer is to call the manufacturer. We all know where that will go.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1553,It was easy to install and all was in the package.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1554,"Good clamp with larger throat than regular ""c"" clamp. Just what I needed for a particular task.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1555,Installs as advertised. Very easy to do and is strong once in place.,,,,,,,,,,,,

1557,I installed this product with ease. All the required parts were in the box as shown. The finish product looks great in the floor.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1558,"Worked wonderful, built a privacy fence in my backyard using these nails. No problems jammed the same as normally would. I would buy these again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1559,Product works great and has good pressure settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1560,great fit and color,,,,,,,,,,,,
1561,"Flushes great.  Installed as expected, it's just pretty heavy being a 1 piece.  I would have expected it to have a soft close lid at this price, luckily we just bought one for the toilet we were replacing.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1562,Works great covers a lot of area . Worth the price.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1563,"Not really designed for anything other than power right out of the box.absolute shame too, as I bought stainless 6 keystone jack terminals... however due to the angled slope and the attachment it doesnt really work well....",,,,,,,,,,,,
1564,Goes great in my nail gun..Gets the job done!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1565,Excellent product. Quality screen and clear instructions to install perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1566,The long handle nozzle flew off as soon as the water pressure hit it. However after collecting the pieces and puttinv back together seems to b doing great now.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1567,Leaks between fixed collars with or without quick connect. No adjustment possible. Absolutely useless.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1568,Love the price and it will save us $$ in the future not using so much water with each flush!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1569,"Pretty easy set up. Good camera. Motion detection works well. Do have some trouble staying connected. Had to move sync box several times. If it goes off line while your out, camera is dead until you can get home to trouble shoot.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1570,Easy to use and worked great,,,,,,,,,,,,
1571,Works well.  Use it for washing the car as well as for watering the lawn and garden.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1572,Well designed product that accomplishes its mission.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1573,"I have installed many screen replacements in the past and this was the only one I have had any trouble with. The folded screen material holds the creases and they end up present in the finished screen product. Also, the rolling tool was too wide for the screen grooves in the frames I had. If doing this again, I would buy screen material that is on a roll to avoid the wrinkles.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1574,"Framing nails in a #8 for sheathing and decking. These end up being cheaper than the 2"". Decent price. Work well in a bostitch stick nailer. 21 degree angle.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1576,These cameras are great for the price! Super clear picture and they even have sound.We have one on our patio so we can talk to our dogs. Night vision is awesome. Well worth the money.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1577,Worked great. I like the raised ground.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1578,Love the chair pads.  Nice quality,,,,,,,,,,,,
1579,I own several sizes of these. They are well constructed and easy to use. Love them!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1580,They hold wood together well,,,,,,,,,,,,
1581,Worked great out of the box. The ability to add a second sprinkler has been useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1582,Product worked very efficiently and accurately.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1583,I bought one for my front porch last year. It works great!  Then I needed one to cover my front driveway as I have unwanted neighbors pulling up in my driveway damaging my sprinklers while I am not home.  Now I can record everything.  The alerts work awesome!   So I bought another one and place it behind my gate to cover my back door and yard.  Thanks ring for these awesome cameras!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1584,Perfect indoor camera with an easy setup,,,,,,,,,,,,
1585,"Delivery was in time. This is a good quality cushion, firm and fully stuffed. I expect it will maintain its ship for quite some time. Wish there was other sizes available.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1586,Wouldn't cut through the crimp at all. Not sure if they didn't adjust it correctly to start but I just cut above it and replaced the connections. Haven't had time to try that yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1587,It gripped the planter box perfectly that needed repair.  All finished now!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1588,"Installing these for two bay windows probably took about 30 minutes tops. The product is great, but the magnetic strips could be more powerful. However I'd recommend it",,,,,,,,,,,,
1589,"Just relocated this camera.I connected it to my Wi-Fi and within 15 minutes the camera was dead and wouldn't connect with nes ( its offline now and will not connect at all ,, You understand disability I have a hard time climbing a ladder and now I have to climb a ladder to get to this fik camera that doesn't work anymore",,,,,,,,,,,,
1590,I enjoy the compact size and great look.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1591,"I would have given it a 5 star but for one of the 5 cameras not wanting to connect to the base station. For the money I would recommend to buy this produce, easy to install and monitor.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1592,All sticks of nails broken into several pieces do to shipping packaging,,,,,,,,,,,,
1593,Used this to build my own screen. Good quality for the price and my application,,,,,,,,,,,,
1594,The new screens are holding up so far and I have big Mainecoon cats pulling on them. They look so much better than my old screens. They are slightly thicker than my old screening material. Instructions were to use thinner rope for installation. My cats were able to pull them lose so went back to the original rope used on the thinner screens. Seems to be holding okay now.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1595,"On a week where I had received the worst product ever from Amazon, (a pool), I received this and the bigger version, (4400 sq ft). This is by far the best sprinkler I have ever had. The bigger version is also a quality piece, just not the value of the 3600 sq ft. one. The bigger one goes wider, not any further. I would recommend this to anyone. We love it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1596,"mounted it to top of my husky tool box. it works like a champ! easy to install, with a strong jaw.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1597,Minimum amount of water for a very positive flush. I highly recommend this toilet.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1598,I just ran a box of these through my framing nailer finishing a basement.  Not 1 misfire or jam. Nails work well and dont come apart.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1599,Needed for a specific project and completed the project. The clamps were easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1600,"Tool does what it was designed for. I would have preferred the handles to be a couple of inches longer for better leverage, but overall they were adequate for the job. The provided instructions were very poor in that they depicted an entirely different crimping tool. I was able to figure out how to adjust the tool through experimentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1601,I love the product. Recommend it for others.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1602,Worked perfectly for a slider screen door screen replacement.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1603,"I needed just a piece of screen, not an entire roll, to complete my project which was to screen in the lower portion of my patio. The use for this was #1 to possibly avoid leaves/dirt from blowing in when the mowers are here on the property weekly & #2 to possibly keep my kitties from venturing off the patio. This piece came neatly folded in a ziploc bag & was the perfect size & I left it folded as it was. All I did was make tiny holes to stick zip ties thru & zip tied it to the patio railings!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1604,Not very strong when cutting,,,,,,,,,,,,
1605,"Durable, easy to set, great coverage. Highly recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1606,"We purchased our out door furniture 5 years ago & love it but the cushions needed some up grading so we purchased a ""so to speak"" higher quality & much higher price replacement as we are firm believers you get what you pay for...... Big mistake .these are even worst than the originals that came with the chairs, I weigh 130 lbs & when I sit on them I touch the frame of the chair , how will my 200 lb. friends weather, BIG WASTE of money!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1607,Wish I had these long ago.  Made cabinet install so much easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1608,"Easy to use, great picture",,,,,,,,,,,,
1609,"These cushions flatten completely when you sit in this cushion! There is absolutely NO cushioning at all. Upon unwrapping, my wife placed a cushion on the patio chair and it collapsed totally, like a sheet of paper. She is a petite 102 pounds.We thought since it was 5 inches thick and foam, it would provide comfort, not total collapse!We returned all these cushions within minutes of sitting in one.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1610,"This toilet works well, better than I thought it would, butIt does sometimes take two flushes after number 2 to have a clean bowl. That's 2.56 gallons, no water savings there. If you don't mind a little dirty water, 1 flush will suffice.The bowl does have a large flat area inside, so I can see someone with small children having a problem with number 2 still stuck in the bowl; it doesn't seem like a lot of water flushes over that area.The toilet does look nice; overall, I'd say we're satisfied, but a 1.6 GPF would be better",,,,,,,,,,,,
1611,Easy to use works well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1612,I was building a cabinet and this was perfect for holding the pieces together. Great that it can be operated with one hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,

1623,Went flat almost immediately no support.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1624,The Expert Gardener metal pistol nozzle is nice and well made. It has a good weight to it because it's metal. This product would be ideal when you need to replace a hose nozzle. It fit well. It's basic in its design. The nozzle produces a high pressure stream of water. It also has a small latch to keep the trigger in a fixed position. Overall a good product.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,

1630,"I like that these seem to have a strong grip. However, the pieces on the end fall off almost instantly. They are a little slippery when opening them. I had one fly of my hand and cut me somehow. But we're using them to keep the liner on our pool, and it works well for those purposes. So I'm satisfied.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1633,I bought 2 of these and with two days one has stopped working,,,,,,,,,,,,
1634,Great product with even better price point!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1635,"I read the reviews before buying and I was not convinced that it would be an easy install. I think a bit of common sense goes a long way!I originally cut a 4"" hole in the ceiling for a small light fixture. I added an old work ceiling box and called it a day. This is until my mother brought home a 30 lb fan instead of a small light fixture. I knew the box couldn't hold a ceiling fan so I had to figure out another solution without tearing the ceiling up. I was able to use this device without making my 4"" hole any larger.. It was perfect. There are two nuts inside that holds a bracket in place that connects the bar to the electrical housing. REMOVE these in order to detach the bar. Once the bar is detached you can install it first. Make sure the bar is level when tightening. Once the bar is tight, you can then clamp the bracket back around the bar and attach the electrical housing. It fit perfectly in the same hole as the other plastic ceiling box that I originally bought. Good stuff",,,,,,,,,,,,
1636,I have done about 30-40 crimps in 2 days and the wratchet gears have a spot that will slip and not continue the crimp. Great idea of a tool but needs better engineering from what I'm reading. Back to home depot I go for an exchange.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1637,"If it was a year from now, I might have given it a 5 star rating, but since I just installed it a week ago, what can I say. It installs like any other screen that I've ever installed and looks nice and black compared to the torn, worn screen that I replaced. It was a little more expensive than the usual screen replacement because it claims to be stronger, but I won't be able to verify that after only a week.

1641,When we took this toilet out of the box we could see immediately that the tank did not match the bowl color. The bowl is bright white and the tank is a darker off white. We took the tank back to Lowes and exchanged it for another one and it still isn't the right color. We also don't like how the tank cover doesn't really lock into place. It sits on top of the tank rim in the back which is strange and doesn't feel secure.,,,,,,,,,,,,

1643,I purchased this camera to monitor the back door of my home and I have to say I'm very pleased with it. The camera installation was simple but I do recommend watching the installation video before putting up the camera.

When I called about it I was told that ""this is the manufacturer and just the way it fits"". I find that answer to be unacceptable. A brand new toilet with brand new toilet seat should not move when someone sits down in it and it is very annoying.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1687,"Recommended with reservations. I was a plumber's apprentice for 2 years (quite awhile ago). I've installed a lot of toilets in my time (I own several rental properties). This gave me a bit of trouble. I had leaks from the tank to the base and the base rocked after my first go. That said American Standard's choice of materials and how the toilet is engineered is actually pretty good. I had to look at the instructions, it was not intuitive. I chose this toilet because it's a bit higher to sit on and the dual flush feature is good.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1699,Camera is clear and bright at night when it connects. Signal needs to be on the 5ghz instead of 2.4ghz. Constant motion alerts even for the wind. Night Vision is outstanding. Also consider buying the solar kit so you never really need to change the battery. Ring App is crap and has issues with connecting to cameras. Also the maintenance/cloud back up service is expensive. Look at alternate options before you come here.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simply hook up to your hose, and it's ready to go!I love how it has so many sprinkler holes, to easily reach allparts of the yard easily. It saturates evenly and doesn't leak!I like how well it is constructed, had a nice screen where youhook the hose up so it doesn't get clogged up.I would recommend this awesome sprinkler to anyone thsywants to water up to 3800 square feet of yard, without anyhassle. Pictures attached show how well this sprinkler is put together.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,

1726,"Shortly after the installation, we had a clogging problem. (Not the kind shown in the TV commercial.) Due to the elongated bottom of the bowl, our plunger wouldn't work. A plumber's snake was required to get it flowing again. The box boasted it has more efficient flushing power. However, compared to our American Standard toilet in our other bathroom, the flushing performance is disappointing. It didn't seem much more efficient than the old toilet it replaced. Reviewing a video made by the manufacturer and examining the inner workings showed me why. I suggest buyers interested in this or any other new toilets do their research especially if flushing performance is important. On the plus side, the height is better than what we had.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1729,"This review is for the Kobalt Up to 1 In-in Pex Cutter Pipe Cutter. This cutter is for rubber, plastic tubing and PEX-tubing; it is NOT for PVC or CPVC or any other type of thicker walled, hard plastic pipe. It is very easy to use and did not require a lot of strength to cut a piece of PEX tubing (and I'm a little old lady).",,,,,,,,,,,,
1730,"I Love these cushions! They were just what I had been looking for! Our new house had a odd sized swing on the porch & I couldn't find a swing cushion that would fit, every one I found was way to small! So I had to improvise! It worked out perfectly!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1731,The blade after one day of use is already warped and broken. Won't cut any sized PVC pipe anymore because the blade is so badly chipped and warped. Even if you any plan on using this for one project it will break on you before you finish.,,,,,,,,,,,,

1736,"This hose nozzle is much heavier than any other nozzle I've ever owned. However, I am hoping that means it will withstand everyday use.

1740,Economical choice for us when we purchased a new home that only had half of the screens for all windows in the house.  Will eventually upgrade to screen that fit the window fully but for the cost and ease of use these can't be beat.  Would definitely recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1741,"I was surprised at how easy this was to install. I did a 32"" x 78"" screen door. The included tool is essential to getting it to fit tightly, be sure to use the grooved wheel first. Best to have your frame on a stable surface like a table and secured so it doesn't slide around while you're working on it. Other tools you'll need are scissors and a razor blade or a very sharp knife. The creases from folding the screening for shipping pull out as so as tension is applied across the frame. I will buy this again when my other screens need replacing.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1742,"This little yard sprinkler is so customizable, you can tackle any size! We have an odd shaped back yard because of the concrete patios and fire pit area I designed. We had to remove the sprinklers because I wanted the terrain about a foot lower. I didn't want to replace the broken back flow system and pay for new sprinklers so I committed to hand watering. Lots of units required me to rotate and switch the sprinkler to a different part of the yard and as a homemaker that gets really tedious when I have so much I already need to focus on. I decided to try this sprinkler, and this is sooo much better than sprinkler system and other hand held sprinklers we had! I'm so happy I have this. I definitely recommend!",,,,,,,,,,,,

1746,"We had to replace three sections of the screening on our porch due to a tree falling on the house this winter. This screen is easy to cut and install. Our cats have climbed it and we have never had damage. A plus to having our 20 ft x 12ft screen in covered porch is this screening is it also darkens the space enough that it limits the sun slightly offering more shade. Also, from the outside you can not see in offering privacy as well. We first installed 8 years ago and other than washing the winter grime and pollen it is care free. A good buy!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1747,Ring Spotlight Cam Wired works great in the back yard. I have full 180 degree range and motion detection at night to pick up anything moving. Also it lets me zone where to detect motion and recording starts automatically. Night vision is great as well. I do hope they will soon have a 4k version but this works for now as I can see everything that has happened whenever I want to on my phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1748,"I'm out of town a lot so I wanted to install a camera to keep an eye on things while I'm away.As you can see in the pic, daytime is great but what pleasantly surprised me was the quality in pitch black. I thought the night time vision would really be too dark to use.Not the case! Love it!I don't experience lag when logging into the camera. I'm just using an SD card to record as of now. Might be upgrading to the cloud soon.Very happy with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1751,"I've owned 4 of these toilets to date. The first two worked flawlessly with a super easy install and great rebate offered by local water company. The last two have been nothing but trouble. The tank itself bubbles (NOT the bowl), right by the black enclosure which surrounds the flush valve. After calling Niagara and speaking with 4 different humans and 1 human manager, multiple times, I have been told to continue waiting while an engineer ""researches"" the problem/solution. I have been awaiting a call back with their findings for over 2 weeks, even after I asked for updates along the way. Unfortunately, a bubbling sound is very bothersome and annoying and apparently it's par for the course according to the human manager over at Niagara. He assured me it is just part of the package deal, which is weird because neither of my two previous Niagara toilets had this issue nor could I find another issue mentioned online anywhere. To this date, Niagara has all but given up on providing mediocre customer service to the customers with any sort of real issue. Their default response is to offer a replacement part before they even understand the symptoms. The greatest part about good ole Troy's response over there at Niagara is that the engineer doesn't need to know what I've tried or adjusted or controlled for in all my tinkering with the toilet over the last month. I'm just curious, is there actually some engineer trying to better understand the bubbling in the tank or is the whole idea a waiting game for me to give up, because that's how it feels. I'm disappointed in their lack of honesty and ability to meet customer's needs when it's not just an easy fix, and for that I give the toilet a 1 star rating because it makes a terrible noise every time I flush.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1752,The brace was easy to install,,,,,,,,,,,,
1753,"This cushion fit well, looks good and offers the same support as smooth ones. I thought that because of the texture it would offer more cushion, but surprisingly no.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1754,"I already own the Ring Doorbell Pro but the way my garage is recessed on the driveway, the doorbell cam cannot see where I park my car at night. We have had recent occurrences of people checking car doors at night so this camera made sense for safety and security and the light (and sensor) is a good deterrent when it turns on.I mounted this cam above the garage door at an angle that has a full view of my car and all the way across the street. The wide angle lens is excellent and shows a lot of real estate. I chose the wired version since I have an outlet within the distance of the provided power wire (very long) and simply drilled a hole at the spot and ran the cord through the wall (See pictures). The kit comes with wire clamps that can be nailed in every 3 feet or so and it makes it look like a professional install. I then plugged it into the outlet on the ceiling where the garage door opener plugs in.It has a lot of features but here are my favorites.- No direct wiring. Simply plug it in a configure. (They sell direct wire and even battery versions as well)- The spotlight sensitivity and area detection are both adjustable so I can set it to only turn on the light when you are half way up the driveway. However, it will start recording when a person is walking on the sidewalk on my side of the street or even across the street.- I set it so it will only record when a person is detected. It will not record when a car drives by. It can be set either this was just a personal preference.- The light intensity is adjustable as well. I have it set to Max and it is blinding.- The night vision is excellent.- Two really cool features: - I can click a button in the smartphone app and speak to my phone and the audio comes out of the camera speaker allowing you to talk to some on the driveway. The microphone on the camera allows the person to talk back. During a recording session the camera records audio. Crystal clear audio even 60 or more feet away. Some neighborhood kids were arguing about cleaning up dog poop on my lawn the other day and I could hear every word and that was 60 feet away. (They cleaned it up) - There is also a button on the app to turn on an audible alarm. The motion sensor will flash red when you do this.- The install is extremely easy and even with drilling that hole took a total of 15 minutes.A lot more can be configured but these are the main items that I use.The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is the zoom functionality. When you zoom in it gets more and more pixelated as you get closer. I do have friends that have other brands and admittedly they do the same thing. Hopefully this gets better in the future.All in all I really like the security they provide. I can wake up in the morning and see all the activity that occurred at night to ensure that nobody was near my house, or I can be alerted in real time during the night if there is activity.5 Stars for ease of install5 Stars for quality and features4 Stars for Zoom in picture quality",,,,,,,,,,,,

1762,"Crimps too tight even at loosest setting. According to the included go - no go gauge, it is okay at one angle, but too tight if I rotate the gauge 90Â°. It is already at the zero calibration setting, so the tool cannot be properly calibrated since there is not a negative one calibration setting. When I returned the tool, I noticed all of the others on the shelf had previously been opened and were taped closed. After reading the other reviews reporting the same problem on home depot's website, I'm guessing they are probably all defective.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorry I bought it. Would return it but I already used it. Useless to me",,,,,,,,,,,,
1769,"This was used to replace 30+ year old outlets on a stage. The outlet is usually used under a lectern, and a narrow dc power supply fits nicely for a light (though the cover won't close with it plugged in). The closing cover does work well and stays shut when standard cords are used. The main reason we went with this model was its use of a decora style outlet. As I mentioned, we were replacing an older outlet that was a standard outlet within 2 feet of a baptistry pool. It was very easy to change out the outlet that this cover came with to a GFCI outlet to make it safer for floor use.The only downside I had was because both the outlet box and the cover need to fit into the hole, there is almost no play on the measurements if you are off. The screws that hold the box to the floor come very close to the edge of the hole so it is important to cut the hole exactly as specified.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1780,"Needed extra cam for my drive way before I left on vacation, I knew I could get a good cam and setup easy before I left gave me more of ease. I'm please with nest the only downside if it goes offline but not to many of those Incidents.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1781,"I could not figure how to adjust until i found a YouTube video. It can spray as far or short as you'd like. Realizing there are two pieces that adjust the rotation was a win. Just set it up to not do a full circle and avoid areas you don't want wet. Also, finding a central Spot along an edge works best for me in my space to avoid watering our trampoline, stairs, etc. Unfortunately, none of our grass areas are wide Open.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1782,Old one broke. My favorite sprinkler. Easy to adjust. Works great,,,,,,,,,,,,
1783,Easy to use! Great value for the money!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1784,Want to upgrade to a chair height commode then this would be an excellent choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1785,"Wide coverage, smooth movement - excellent purchase!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1786,This sprinkler is heavy duty made of metal. Great adjustability and coverage. Probably the last sprinkler I will ever buy. If I have to buy another one it will surely be this one. 5 Stars !!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1787,"works well, good value",,,,,,,,,,,,
1788,Works well and is of good quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1789,This kit is very easy to use and such a great price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1790,We bought three of these toilets and installed them ourselves.  I love the dual flush feature.  They've been in use for several months now and we are very happy with them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1791,Durable. Simple to install. Works well against small bugs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1792,-The camera still utilizes 2G WiFi and 2K HD does not work well with 2G. They should invest in 5G to run 2k HD much smoother. Didn't see any difference from the regular 1080 HD.-Night Vision does NOT work even with Night Vision settings turned on in settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1793,"Steel City products are well made and have always performed as indicated, intended and expected without any problems...There is not much to say about a 4"" square box, if the knockouts open easily and break off cleanly and the 8/32 screws are not stripped m, then the box is great...",,,,,,,,,,,,
1794,Nails run great through my Rigid gun. Only con is if you have to pull one the heads break right off.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1795,It was very easy to install and quite reasonable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1796,The product was easy to install and is very sturdy. I purchased and installed with hugger ceiling fan Internet #300930186Model #AL383LED-BNStore SKU #1002269802.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1797,"Easy to turn on and off, and changing the settings is so nice to use without changing the head controls.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1798,I bought this item because of the very good rating. But while using this the red cover is coming off and very easily torn off.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1799,"Great product, worked great!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1800,"Love the colors and the quality, very soft as well",,,,,,,,,,,,
1801,Great tool. Smooth square cuts and gets in tight spaces.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1802,"Works great, solidly made",,,,,,,,,,,,
1803,Great camera and great pricing too Clear image and coverage to spy on our pup while we are away,,,,,,,,,,,,
1804,Great retro-fit option for ceiling fan installation.  Very solid and easy to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1805,I bought two of these for my new lawn. They work great for covering large areas.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1806,"These are a great toilet. Easy to install. Flush system is effective, and you cannot beat the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1807,"I bought these to hold styrene plastic parts together until the glue dries but I don't think I can use them for such as they are way too strong. Great for anything else so I'll hang on to them for other purposes. Oh, don't put your finger between the jaws...OUCH",,,,,,,,,,,,
1808,"Took me two hours to install but I guess that's fair as I have a quite large and high window. But it was easy to install and the instruction was clear. I'm satisfied with the product, now I can keep all the mosquitoes and flies outside! If the plastic on the top layer could be black it would be even better~ but now it's good enough for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1809,Its great for a small camera.  I can basically see my hole kitchen without putting it to spend. Love it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1810,This hose nozzle is comfortable to use for my arthritic hands. Range of spray types is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1811,easy to install and use,,,,,,,,,,,,
1812,Cuts as it should. My only advice would be to let it be manually compressed to the pipe with the trigger pulled or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1813,These nails are way above average on gripping hold but if you have to remove a nail it's better to use a hacksaw then trying to pull it out with a pry bar. I've had better luck with Senco nails but their expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1814,Description said set.... Only for 1 chair and now they are charging me to send it back. Bad customer service.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1815,when Ireceived the package it was opened and nails were missing out of the box.( very disappointed),,,,,,,,,,,,
1816,Well worth the price. Well made.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1817,"I really like how easy it is to set this up in the areas that are difficult to water. There weren't any instructions but it didn't take long to figure it out. It can even be rotated once stuck in the ground.The spike seems a bit flimsy, as I notice it bent a bit going into my lawn. To be fair there's mostly clay down there and it's been dry for a while, but I now know to be careful when inserting into the ground and make sure it goes straight in.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1818,Very flimsy and screen barely attached and no spline.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1819,can't find these anywhere for this price...they are all the same but harbor freight is by far the best price... 50% at least,,,,,,,,,,,,
1820,The toilet flushes so much better than the other toilet I had. It's the right height and is comfortable to sit on.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1821,"These clamps are great, they are comfortable to use and with the rubber plates don't damage your work surface.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1822,Fit the Ryobi1 18V Airstrike 18 Ga nailer. Went into the wood great and didn't cause any misfires. The heads of the brad nails are small so they do not create a large area to wood putty.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1823,This sprinkler is mostly of metal construction and has a flow and sweep adjustments.Both adjustments are easily operated. The flow does not shut it all the way off on the minimum setting.I like the sturdiness of the metal construction and grab handle slot.If I had it longer and it did not falter I would give it 5 stars.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1824,"The bathrooms in our house had the old fashion low toilets. We are doing new flooring in our home and decided to replace the 2 toilets and the guest bath vanity and light. It's amazing how spending under $300. we have 1 bathroom that looks like it's brand new and the other has a nice tall new toilet. The height makes a lot of difference when you get older or are tall. So much more comfortable. We didn't want a lot of bells and whistles, just the basics but taller. Great choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1825,"The nice, handy belt pack arrived unusable. The case is in two pieces. This was shipped in a clear plastic bag, placed loose in a shipping bag. Would return them, but I can't wait for replacements.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1826,Great quality. We've received several compliments on this cushion,,,,,,,,,,,,
1827,Makes nice straight cuts,,,,,,,,,,,,
1828,"The Expert Gardener Industrial Nozzle, is a great basic sprayer to connect to your garden hose. It is made of hard plastic, and feels very solid. I have already dropped it on the concrete, and not a scratch on it, after it bounced around. The parts that connect to the hoses are metal, which makes them even more durable. The sprayer design allows you to decide what type of spray to use, by just squeezing the lever differently, from a very light fan type of spray for watering delicate flowers, to a powerful spray, that shoots about 25 feet, for things like washing your car. The grip has a notch for your index finger, which helps it stay in your hand, even when wet. There is also a metal flip piece, that allows you to set the spray level, and not have to continuously squeeze the handle to keep it spraying. The other cool design thing, is the screw piece on the end of the nozzle, so you can attach another hose to it, or attach those weed and feed spray attachments to it, to give more power and control over the water flow, when using those types of things. If you are looking for a basic sprayer, but want a few extra bells and whistles, I highly recommend the Expert Gardener Industrial Nozzle.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
1829,Sprayer doesn't adjust spray pattern. You can screw it all the way in or out and the water stream stays the same..,,,,,,,,,,,,
1830,Worked as expected - no problems,,,,,,,,,,,,
1831,Worked well in my Ryobi finish nailer,,,,,,,,,,,,
1832,"Very useful and well built, you can't go wrong with this clamp!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1833,So easy to slide... i hate looking at dirty screens all year and its hard to clean windows with screens also i have flower boxes i have to water ... these screens are so easy to just put in window and close down on top... when im done u can either store away or just push them forward to keep them in the window for later use... very nice!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1834,Work perfectly in my new estwing framing nailer,,,,,,,,,,,,
1835,Works better than I expected! Worth the money.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1836,Very good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,
1837,Nails are the best value I could find and fired without any problems,,,,,,,,,,,,
1838,Bought in July and was broken by September.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1839,No jams. Worked perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1840,Wonderful quality and workmanship.  I am pleasantly surprised!!  I would order again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1841,Watched a video on how to put in. Easy install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1842,"just fine, work smooth ,",,,,,,,,,,,,
1843,I found this box a perfect fit in my customers recently gutted family room,,,,,,,,,,,,
1844,"Quality Control missing/not exercised for small ticket items - my first order was a cut out piece of screen in an ""L"" shape dimension (less than full screen as ordered). Hopefully my second order placed 10/12/21 @ 10:17a is not a repeat.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1845,It was easy to install and so much better than my 1960s toilet! Super happy with the purchase,,,,,,,,,,,,
1846,The product felt a bit cheap and easily would tear,,,,,,,,,,,,
1847,"No drips, no leaks, no issues changing from one flow pattern to the next. Doesn't have a way to regulate the flow to somewhere less than 100%. You have to grip it and squeeze the handle constantly. There is a loop to lock it 100% open but there is no way to reduce the pressure down without manual gripping. Hands get sore. Husband prefers wand style that is less reactive to water pressure with flow regulator. On the plus side, no drips at hose connection or when cycling thru the 7 spray patterns. This is a back up nozzle for when the preferred ones give out due to hard water and AZ heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1848,"Since this is a heavier ""pet resistant"" screen, it is slightly more difficult to work with.  However, once installed, it looks great.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1849,Just put up 2 weeks ago. Two cameras that back up to each other. Will see activity on one that should continue to the other but doesn't. On the plus side has clear pictures even at night. Setting up zones to block off a highway and used people only. It will still show motion of vehicles. Still learning but like having the cameras and felt Google will keep updating and improving their nest app.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1850,"My only complaint is the seat is flimsy. They should offer a wooden seat as an option. When installing best if you have two people. Its heavy. I installed it solo without a problem by placing 2 by 4 s on each side of the floor flange, placing the toilet on the boards to center it and then kicking the boards out as i lowered it. Lined up with one try",,,,,,,,,,,,
1851,"This is my review on the Expert Gardener Metal Pistol Nozzle. This nozzle is a smaller sized nozzle than I had expected and it seems to be a lighter weight metal, which I'm afraid won't last past one summer. This nozzle would be appropriate for gardening and yard use for sure. The water stream can be adjusted by using the gold colored screw on the back side of the nozzle. Even though you can adjust it, it's really not really accurate on the adjusting part. You can shoot a full powered stream of water or make it a spread out shower pattern but that's about it. This nozzle is good when you clean out horse trailers or when you wash pickups and it works good to spray the under side of a muddy pickup too. These are handy tools to have around the yard during the summer for sure.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
1852,"Fit my window well, easy to use",,,,,,,,,,,,
1853,"Cheap, but to hard to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1854,Glad I went with these instead of wire cutters. Good quality and cut like butter.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1855,"All the settings work well.The Jet setting has a very direct jet stream. The Stream is tight, and does not break up.Decent shower setting, as well as the others.The Soaker setting needs a bit of tweaking in the nozzle hole to make the water stream out better.But overall, like this, plus the Large easy to grip handle.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1856,"Worked as described , easy ratcheting so no need lots of pressure to crimp",,,,,,,,,,,,
1857,All the ones in the big box stores were two and three times the price of this one. I don't know if it would hold up to constant pro use but for around the house and doing RV repairs this works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1858,"I liked the way the tool worked, but was only able to crimp about 5 joints before the metal jaw broke. I think I would have rated much higher if it has lasted",,,,,,,,,,,,
1859,The nail gun worked well with these galvanized coil nails.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1860,"keep getting an ""unable to reach the blink cloud. Please try again later.Error 503 code...cannot use camerawaste of money",,,,,,,,,,,,
1861,"I did not like these at all! They were beautiful and would make great decor, but are not that great functionality-wise. It felt like we were sitting in the chairs with nothing under us.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1862,"This cutter, cuts 1/2 in PVC clean and fast. One of the best I have ever used.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1863,I tried both of these great nozzles. They are heavy duty and are very efficient. Easy to use and work great. I was surprised and very impressed at how they looked. They look very expensive and rich looking. They are so nice that I take them off the hose and clean them every time I use them and keep them in doors. One word to describe them is WONDERFUL. Thank you. TazzySee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1864,TheAqua JoeSprinkler is perfect...Ive tried every type of lawn sprinkler over the years only to be disappointed...This is the one I've been looking for..so easy to set a pattern and no more nasty looks from people walking by on my sidewalk...I can control it with the simple sliding mechanism. Also come with a handy tool for cleaning the holes. I highly recommend it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1865,Did a brake recently and the c-clamp worked perfect on pushing my brake calibers back so I could install new brake pads.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1866,Worked perfect with my nail gun. No jams or miss fire,,,,,,,,,,,,
1867,Has lasted a few months. So far so good. When you open the box it seems like it's a lot of pieces but it's easy to install,,,,,,,,,,,,
1868,I research this tool and found a price range from $100 to $20. This tool was on the lower cost in the range and I on needed to make a minor repair so I purchased it. When it came in I made the repair in a matter of minutes. I pressure tested the plumbing line and it was perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1869,Good quality clamps for various uses. I would highly recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1870,"We purchased the indoor camera, thinking it was like the Nest IQ Outdoor Camera but jut did not have the face recognition. Well, we found we could not watch video of past activity. We can only see still images of the activity with the camera. This is fine, we just needed to adjust our expectations. In the future, we will most likely stick with the indoor or outdoor IQ Nest cameras. They cost more, but are well worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1871,These work beautifully for the chairs around my fire pit. They are very nice and comfortable!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1872,This doesn't work any better than a standard nozzle.Don't bother!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1873,Perfect kit for a sliding screen at a great price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1874,Perfect fit for tool,,,,,,,,,,,,
1875,Great Product and easy to install. This is my fifth camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1876,If you like to do diy around your house this is worth the money and a life saver.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1877,Work as they should best bang for your buck,,,,,,,,,,,,
1878,Cheap quality. Most of them couldn't go in straight. i used Porter-Cable without any isses. I am returning them,,,,,,,,,,,,
1879,"Helped me with temporary fixing my car, so far it's holding on pretty well. Maybe it's gonna be a permanent fix.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1880,works well heavy enough that it doesnt flip over,,,,,,,,,,,,
1881,I used it around my patio for mosquitoes and flies and it works great. Also deflects the sun. Its looks really nice to.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1882,I love the way this tool cuts into tubing while being so manageable in the hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1883,Durable exterior metal receptacle box that was easy to install and protects the GFI outlet.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1884,"This thing is junk. It stopped connecting about 2 months after we got it. Also, only one person can view at a time. Save your money and get an actual baby monitor.It won't connect to the Blink servers and keeps saying my password is wrong which it's not. I've reset the stupid thing more times than I can count. Definitely going to seek a refund.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1885,Very easy to install & has been amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,
1886,this camera works great and it was surprisingly very easy to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1887,All 3 toilets leaked due to the poor quality valve seals. Poor overall quality,,,,,,,,,,,,
1888,"If you are expecting 9 dollar cutters to hold up against pvc you are wrong, however for a plumber or do it yourself kind of person its great for 1/2 to 1"" pex, i used for 6 months of hard everyday use, for 9 dollars it is a quality tool",,,,,,,,,,,,
1889,The mist is not a mist! The holes are not in line for the shower! For the price I paid a $7 would have have worked better. Don't waste your money!See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1890,No way to contact manufacturer for stain on cushion seat. Amazon warranty under SquareTrade requires one first contact manufacturer which is not possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1891,Very well built construction. The blade is shaped so that it bites into the pipe straight .,,,,,,,,,,,,
1892,"Just picked this up from the 45th street Walmart. They took a return that was supposed to go to claims, with the return slip still on it, and gave me that. There are pieces visibly missing from it, it was covered with dirt at the base, overall a poor experience but not unexpected considering its Wal-Mart. I'd be wary of this store and any merchandise you're buying out of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1893,Great product and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1894,Those people giving 5 stars are either paid by the company or they're receiving a different product because I just bought this and the rubber part where the water comes out keeps popping off and water sprays everywhere and it won't completely tighten to the hose. Not even worth the cheap price.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1895,"I really like the clarity of the cameras and being able to talk to people on them. The one problem I have, is they continually seem to go offline. That's the only frustration I have with them.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1896,This is clap works great and is easy to use. I was surprised that it has a lifetime guarantee!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1897,"Sturdy, easy, good value",,,,,,,,,,,,
1898,"When you try to use it with pressure is all shooting water all over. The smaller nozzle is supposedly more for a straight pressure stream, it does not shoot with pressure, it shoots a more of a spread stream. No good in my books.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1899,Worked as planned. Loaded easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1900,"It leaks, has very little projection. I missed the return date or I would have returned it. I have owned many sprinklers, this was the worst.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1901,Great holding power but the orange stabilizer easily snap off. If don't mind using them without the flat edge they work fine,,,,,,,,,,,,
1902,Comfort height great for older people. Quick quiet flush,,,,,,,,,,,,
1903,Can cut with scissors which made custom fit easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1904,Very comfortable and fits perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1905,"always liked the melnor products, but i do not think this will last more than 2 years. Too much plastic but for the price it is ok.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1906,"This tool WAS working well, but then broke after only about 15-20 crimpings.  It got stuck in the ""clamped"" position.  When i hit the 'release' switch it would not release.  I was able to get it open after fiddling with it for 20 minutes.  Then it got stuck again and I could not fix it.Very disappointed in this tool, as it left me in quite a bind.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1907,"Wanted to have power to table in middle of room. Didn't want something sticking up very far, or likely to fill with dirt and dust. This one went in as easily as anything requiring cutting a hole in the floor could. Top looks great, holes seal. Plug fits down inside so only the cord sticks out. definitely recommend if you are tired of tripping on extension cords on the floor.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1908,Last week.  Was so easy to use   Less then  30 mins to install along with Ceiling Fan,,,,,,,,,,,,
1909,Well made steel box with several mounting holes providing options. Great KO options also.,,,,,,,,,,,,

1911,Great product and works great in my Milwaukee cordless framing gun!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1912,These worked really well in my decades old Paslode Impules clipped head nailer. These are full round head with an off-set. I spent the day working on a cedar fence and fired about 450 nails - not a single jam or problem all day!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1913,"So far so good. They are performing as advertised. I bought three, linked them to my Alexa. Well worth the money",,,,,,,,,,,,
1914,Good quality clamps. Strong hold. Very easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1915,Great quality metal electric box that met my needs,,,,,,,,,,,,
1916,No issues with loading or jamming,,,,,,,,,,,,
1917,"Easy to setup, great video quality and aesthetically pleasing, especially compared to the Canary it replaced. Helps me keep an eye on our elderly dog and gives me a clear view of both front and rear entrances.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1918,This brace comes with all the hardware and instructions to install to your ceiling. It holds up to 70 lbs of weight. Comes with 4 screws and ground screw. You have 4 knockout locations. I had up in 5 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1919,Good fit with solid color. Not as thick as some others but provides reasonable comfort.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1920,This sprinkler is great! It has great build quality. It is made of good materials. It is extremely customizable! It is exactly what I needed to water my garden! This is a great product!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1921,"Siphon action of toilet not at all adequate for even basic function of toilet. Cannot recommend this toilet, except to say its very pretty.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1922,"Perhaps my unit is broken or I just don't know how to adjust it properly, even after watching a U-Tube video.  My garden is 20 x 30, only 600 square feet and I cannot get full coverage.  I do like the gentle quality of the watering, unlike the rainbird style sprinkler I tried first that was too hard on the plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1923,The screen was easy to hang up on my patio and enclose my patio to keep out insects and gives me more entertain family and friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1924,Great value for the price. Delivered on time and without damage. Very happy!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1925,"Great accessory by a great brand.  Out of the box, they felt sturdy and what you would expect from the Dewalt brand.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1926,Poor thickness. Able to feel bars underneath. Back part of cushion is short and doesn't cover back of standard chair.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1927,Great perfect for out door weather resistant and dog distant to dog chewed them up rubber lining only still works perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,
1928,"This is a great, quality toilet for the price. Even our Plumber that installed them was impressed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1929,"Fair price. Does the job well, couldn't ask for more.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1930,Super easy to install and I love that it came with both the spline and the tool to install it because I have one but I couldn't find it,,,,,,,,,,,,
1931,Extremely well made and a great price for the 2 pack! Wanted something to attach to spray bottles for weed and feed and other lawn care products. These are superior to any I have purchased before!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1932,"Nice Resolution, Excellent Picture Quality and Wide Viewing Angle. Perfect Except only 2.4GHz Wifi. Good buy",,,,,,,,,,,,
1933,The directions with this thing are horrible. Out of the box it won't spin. You need to turn the red heads to the side and then it will either spin fast or crazy fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1934,"Little lost with all the great reviews. I had so many issues using these. Always jamming up, chain breaks easy. Could be my dewalt making these such a nightmare. Complate waste of money.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1935,The rubber pieces continuously fall off. It's a struggle to clamp without using 2 hands to hold the rubber piece while tightening with the other hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1936,"Product was easy to install and so far works great, It's price couldn't be beat.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1937,I love these cushion. Thick and comfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1938,"The material used to build this kit can't be cheaper, otherwise would be paper. The metal in a beer can is stronger than this kit. If you're framing a large window (longer than 34 inches) don't waste your money on this, the forming of arc and bending would make your frame useless even without stretching the mesh. This is so cheap that only for holding it in your hand to cut it, it will bend. This is the best sample of 25 cents cost of production to make a large profit over the 500 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1939,Broke the 1st time I used it. Find one made it of brass,,,,,,,,,,,,
1940,I purchased this sprinkler since we recently extended our backyard patio so the lawn is smaller and the old sprinkler was watering the lawn and patio. This sprinkler is easy to adjust so you water only what you want to water. Having said it is great for small lawns it can also be adjusted to water quit a large area if that's what you are looking for.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1941,This trigger clamp was the perfect tool to hold my kitchen drawer back together. I would definitely recommend this clamp.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1942,Bought this and other Ring cameras and leas than a year later this flood light camera is now dead. For the cost of these and it doesn't even last a year. Worthless and now I have to buy a new one,,,,,,,,,,,,
1943,"We love our Ring cameras. This spotlight cam seems to hold the best charge. Sometimes the battery will die even though it's connected to the solar panel. The alarm sound is great, very loud with a bright light. Generally speaking it's my favorite Ring product so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1944,Most sprayers are quiet cheap and only last one season. This one seems to be heavy duty so excited to see if it holds up a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1945,Very forgiving when I need to undo my mistakes. Truly is see through - makes a nice clean difference. Well worth rescreening â€¦ an affordable facelift.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1946,Measure closely this item is thick and true to size!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1947,First two try's at getting the sprinkler in the ground resulted in the sprinkler popping out and spraying me. I learned to sprint again! Third round I had it mastered. It is plastic! So I am not sure of the durability. It throws lots of water and covers a large area.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1948,"Excellent, good looking, easy to use, great height esp. for disabled person that must use wheelchair and walker in bathroom and we feel great for saving water!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1949,"The mesh doesn't hold in place, there is waviness in the screen, a real disappointment",,,,,,,,,,,,
1950,"Very good nails, don't cause any jams and they are all consistent.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1951,its a clamp and works like a clamp should,,,,,,,,,,,,
1952,"Nails work fine and feed well. Bought 31/2 and 2 inch nails. However, both plastic box's were broken on arrival. WTF. Read the reviews and found this is common. Should look into that",,,,,,,,,,,,
1953,"Love. Love. Love. Great quality and picture. Got in addition with existing doorbell cam. Way better quality and clarity than the doorbell camera. Definitely feels like I'm at home all the time. Also long range, as I can multiple houses. Had to adjust the range because I had so many alerts to my phone. Very happy with the purchase and discount Home Depot had.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1954,"glad this includes the sd card. the panoramic function, the night vision and the two-way talk make this the perfect pet cam for us.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1955,"The screen was easy to work with. I have repaired 3 screens already, saving myself $60.00.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1956,"I am currently trying to find replacement caps (what regulates pressure and allows for sprinkling rather than surging)  for the arms of the sprinkler head on several of this model; some disappeared into the mulch of the garden last autumn and a few more are missing now as I begin testing all my sprinklers again. Are there replacement caps available for purchase? I have eight of these telescoping sprinklers, purchased only last spring, and am missing at least one cap on each of those. Please advise.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1957,Once installed don't open/remove material easily tears,,,,,,,,,,,,
1958,Very poor quality ok for holding up a curtain but nothing else the ends broke of just very cheap and not great value,,,,,,,,,,,,
1959,Works great with a powerful flush.   Our house had old toilets that barely flushed. I got two of these and what a difference. The elongated is great for tall people.  Great price too.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1960,Order came on time and the cushions are just what I wanted. Good value.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1961,"Replacing original window screens that had big wholes in it from cats trying to get bugs on other side of screen. This seems pretty sturdy, looks nice and keeps bugs out. Make sure to get installation tool if you don't have one because it makes the job alot easier.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1962,I like tje Ring camera i was easy to install an compatible with my ring door bell. Hook up in minutes. Nice,,,,,,,,,,,,
1963,its pretty delicate which is ok if you dont have kids or pets but is not helpful when you do. this though does make it easy to work with.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1964,This is the new version of the old work fan box. This one is easier to connect the box to the bracket. I've used 10 of these this year alone. It makes the work so much easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1965,"It's a bit thin and a little misshapen from packaging. Hoping it will flatten out over time. The foam is quite light, doesn't feel like great quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1966,Built sturdy. The same product can be made in the USA and keep the trade deficit down,,,,,,,,,,,,
1967,"These are perfect. True color and sizing, a perfect replacement for cushions which had faded over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1968,Having to three different size 16 gauge nailer's made my DIY project easy,,,,,,,,,,,,
1969,I purchased this toilet about a year ago and I have no issues with it.  This toilet is in our master bathroom and is used several  times a day.  It flushes everything and rarely leaves anything behind.  I like the height and the low water consumption.  I will probably buy this toilet again for the second bathroom in the house.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1970,I already have a different camera that I'm happy with. Thought I would try this one since they are comparable in price and features. Overall not impressed. Rarely did it ever notice anyone at the front door. Thought maybe it was the placement or something like that. Moved it and no change. Then they want to charge for monitoring. You can literally stand right in front of the window and it won't pick you up. I moved the other camera that I have to the same place as this one and get constantly better detection. I would buy another Wyze cam since I've had no issues with mine.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1971,It doesn't work sometimes always have to reset or reboot and reinstall.  It doesn't have a sensor to catch an image It only works close up like 2-3 ft.  I would not recommend this cam at all,,,,,,,,,,,,
1972,This brace was very easy to use and lined up very well. Very sturdy and very easy to turn. Great product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1973,Good quality for a good price,,,,,,,,,,,,
1974,Bought this for my basement window works great and was easy to install,,,,,,,,,,,,
1975,"I have 2 of these. 1 is at my RV and the other is at my apartment. I travel with my job, so I'm not at either place all the time. These work great. They are easy to place almost anywhere. The battery last a long time. I did purchase a spare battery to keep charged and have a quick change out.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1976,"Purchased this for a remodel project. Ratcheting handle makes holding/cutting the material easy. Seems very good quality and cut 2"" schedule 40 PVC with ease. Happy I purchased it!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1977,Perfect for watering areas up to 15 ft by 15ft without losing water in the air like oscillating sprinklers. Wheels make it easy to reposition and brass fittings add to longevity.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
1978,"Good flexibility, easy to install, consistent quality throughout the roll.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1979,I purchased these to use in my new Ryobi cordless nailer. They worked great!,,,,,,,,,,,,
1980,Comes with everything you need. My only hiccup was not having a grnd symbol at the location where the grnd screw goes just to make sure I was in talking in the intended location sine the serew had a hard time threading in,,,,,,,,,,,,
1981,Typical but made very well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1982,All around you seek accounts comes in different sizes two four eight twelve excellent for doing front brakes collapsing the cylinder and woodwork and Aviation hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1983,"Works nice, although has a tougher time with the thin pvc plastic you get in kits",,,,,,,,,,,,
1984,I was not satisfied with the quality of this item I follow the directions on how to inflate the cushions but that didn't happen I'm thinking about returning these for an exchange maybe this was a defective item but I would not recommend this item to anyone,,,,,,,,,,,,
1985,I use the camera at a weekend house and it gives me peace of mind to be able to see what's going on and watch the workers. Ease of installation and familiarity made it the perfect indoor camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1986,Soft. A little thin but good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1987,These little attachments are fantastic. The only problem is you have to remove them from the hose everytime you are finished using them. They will corrode. BUT THEY ARE FANTASTIC. Lots of power!!! These little attachment puts the other expensive ones to shame.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1988,"Cushions were well made , very comfortable , nice fabric",,,,,,,,,,,,
1989,"It worked well enough for the small project we did.  The cutters were hard to get open wide enough for 1/2 pipe but, that is how they work.  Natural tension cuts the pex.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1990,The crimp tool worked perfectly.  First time working with PEX B plumbing - the crimp rings worked easily -no leaks !,,,,,,,,,,,,
1991,I made a bad choice! Not strong enough and the orange tabs coming off very easy,,,,,,,,,,,,
1992,Plastic parts are to brittle and should be improved for longevity,,,,,,,,,,,,
1993,"My 22 year old son complained about the ergonomics of the seat. Stayed in a great Nashville hotel, New, and they had the same. There you go!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1994,This toilet flushes 10x better than my one I had put in when I built my house. If I needed to replace more toilets in my house this model would be what I would replace them with.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1995,Good clamp for the money. Much lighter than my old bar clamps.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1996,"Sprays much further than our previous hardware store one even with low water pressure. Cycles well, does not get stuck and has super easy adjustment",,,,,,,,,,,,
1997,"Installed new ceiling fan where a light was and the cheap bracket wouldn't work found this at lowes, and it made the job sp much easier. Worth every penny!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1998,Worked great. Simple to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1999,These clamps are quick to use for light duty clamping needs. Not sure I would use.them where a lot of.clamping strength is needed. I have used them on a.couple of furiture repair projects with great results.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2000,"Seems to be of good quality, but no cat or dog have tested it yet time will tell. I would by it again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2001,Is very hard to install!!  Don't buy it! I bought it online without seeing it for a small bathroom the should change the design and make the side holes bigger.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2002,This nozzle takes the fun out of twilight watering by making it very difficult to adjust. Also leaky despite diff washers.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
2003,Good price. Work well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2004,It worked really well.  Good instructions on the installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2005,I am impressed with the ease of use and the expandibilty is tremendous. The clamps interlock to double the length of the span for use. The clamps are lightweight and durable. They can even be used with one hand.I would recommend these for woodworking and many home projects.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2006,"These clamps are strong, light, and durable.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2007,Nails are high quality! No jammed gun or any other issues with these,,,,,,,,,,,,
2008,I was surprised at how easy it was to use. it's light and cuts beautiful,,,,,,,,,,,,
2009,The Nest has been offline ALL week! I'm not sure what happened. It's definitely not working. Ugh!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2010,"Good, heavy duty box.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2011,Like the style & ease of use. Perfect companion for my new expandable hose.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2012,Works perfect. Easy to use,,,,,,,,,,,,
2013,Don't believe the bad reviews. Creases disappear if you install it correctly. Does not rip if installed properly with care.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2014,It is working perfect to me,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,Works great. Lots of setting options.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2016,"Looks great on our wood floors, sturdy and easy to install",,,,,,,,,,,,
2017,"This is a simple tool for a very specific purpose. It has a good hand feel. Alignment of the tubing is easy; it's hard to imagine how you could possibly make a bad cut with this tool. Safety lock is easy to operate and locks securely. In the closed position, the tip of the blade rests proud of the toe end just far enough to cut through an expansion ring if you need to remove it to take apart a joint. Much better than using a utility knife and guessing on depth of cut.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Great screens for the price.  Expand to fit old victorian windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,Works well for what I need it to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,Works great and it is easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2021,"Easy to install. A Delta video on YouTube was especially helpful. The reason for 4 of 5 stars is that the plastic seat is, well, plastic. It's not nearly as nice as a laminated wooden seat. It would be just a few more dollars for Delta to include the laminated seat. It would be worth it to pay a little extra to have the nicer seat. Now I'm shopping for a replacement seat and will have to spend a little more than that.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2022,Simply said this box does what it is designed to do well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2023,Broke after a week. Water leaks,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024,"Perfect upgrade for my remodeld bathroom. Good quality, i will upgrade my other bathrooms with this toilet.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2025,Super easy to install - takes less than 30 minutes! Home Depot Canada has the best price just under $16 for the screen repair kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2026,Great product.Their nails. What more can you say.Great price.Don't jam. Works well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2027,Cheap and cuts like a charm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2028,I ordered screen kit to replace older screens. This kit  can't hold frame  together without bending and twisting anything bigger than 40 inch x 25 inch. Its waste of time and money.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2029,I use these in my Paslode gun. Always works well,,,,,,,,,,,,
2030,Pvc Cutter struggled at clean cuts and rotating around the pipe itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2031,Love it. No leaking,,,,,,,,,,,,
2032,The two copper wires that are attached to the nails vary in width spacing and jam up the gun. Today I used the gun for 6 hours and had at least 9 jam ups.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2033,Works the way they should when you put them in a nail gun !!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2034,"Always wanted one. Finally needed one. Did what I expected. Excellent value. Would but again, but will never have to.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2035,This clamp worked great for building my aquarium. They stayed in place firmly and had great gripping space.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2036,Very nice quality and super cute design. Perfect for my smaller guest bathroom!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2037,"We have wanted one of these for years. This one is well made,heavy and works great! We mounted it to our workbench (screws included) and have used it several times already. Don't hesitate!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2038,I used this to repair a few holes in the screens of my pop up camper. Works great. The color is black and you can see the adhesive strips fabricated into it. In case that matters to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2039,Good reliable tool.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2040,The color and pattern are perfect as replacement cushions for my outdoor tables. I am more than pleased.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2041,Piece of junk don't waste your money.  Almost got two clips to work before it broke.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2042,"Very nice, very comfortable, just enough padding for chairs and able to withstand the weather",,,,,,,,,,,,
2043,"I purchased this nozzle based on the high ratings. Unfortunately after less than 4 months of use, it will not completely shut off.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2044,We used them with the original screen tight system and it worked out great spline of 1/8 diameter was perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,
2045,"Cannot speak to longevity, but it got here within one day and it works like it said it would. Covers large area for a small sprinkler. I am pleased thus far.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2046,We like this toilet. Flush is strong which helps keep the bowl clean. Was easy to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2047,Easy to install and the quality of the picture is excellent!! Love it!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2048,"It's a standard (qa) quick adjusting C-clamp.. OK for non commercial purposes.  The adjustment clamping screw is a-bit light weight... Although it is fair for the price point..Like I said ""not for commercial""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2049,"Took about 2 hours to install with cutting through the flooring and rerouting the wiring. I had some difficulty getting the right side hole. I cut a hole following the template but it was too small by about an 1/8"". I enlarged the hole by 1/4"", 1/8"" more than I intended and had to splay the metal cage a bit. Because of this, the cap would lay flush with the floor. After some futzing around I came out ok. The design seems needlessly finicky.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2050,"Easy to work with, I'll definitely buy it again when needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2051,"After only two uses, the cushions which were are already breaking down and look just as worn as the cushions that are six years old. Will be returning them. I do not recommend these.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2052,"Bought this tool to help with a project I was working on at home (Field Hockey Goal).  Do not purchase this product, if trying to cut 1 1/2 inch PVC.  Invest in a ratcheting tool.  I had to use a hacksaw to start and then use this cutter to get through the pipe.  The handle wound up cracking trying to make my fifth cut.  This maybe good for PVC or Plex with a smaller diameter.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2053,The nails worked perfectly in my Dewalt nailer. No misfeeds or doubles encountered. will use this product again and again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2054,"Just works great, quick and easy!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2055,Very easy to install the cats are already enjoying it!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2056,"Looks to be a good clamp. Was not my first choice, but because the store only had one of all the rest I chose this one. It was easy to use and clamps secure. Just wish it had a larger clamping surface.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2057,"The Orbit nozzle is a high quality, solid nozzle that is comfortable in my hand and easy to use. Just push the lever forward and the water flows without having to hold the handle down to water. And you can adjust the water flow with the lever. It is a much better quality nozzle over it's competition. I would recommend this nozzle to others.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2058,"We love it. Easy to install, has a dark shade to it for privacy. Hope it will hold up for years to come",,,,,,,,,,,,
2059,solid brad nails at a great price,,,,,,,,,,,,
2060,Easy to use and a nice tool to have in my clamp arsenal.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2061,"My old toilet was new in 1978, more than 3 gallons per flush, and clogged about 1/3 of the time.  The plunger was a necessary accessory. I have been using the new toilet for 3 weeks, and it hasn't clogged even once. Like wow and a half, a much better design than my old toilet, and it only uses 1.28 gallons of water.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2062,Had an older oscillating sprinkler that needed replaced.   What I like about this model is the ability to adjust to the size of the yard.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2063,"The nozzle is fairly light weight but sturdy.  I like how the tip spins for horizontal or vertical spraying.  The disappointment is the pressure. It might be of high pressure used with the power washer. But as I used it on the garden hose, it is not any different than the other hose nozzles of various styles.  The pulsating stream is just a faster version of sliding your thumb left and right over the hose end. The impact I noticed was that the sound of the water being sent side to side by the little thing in the nozzle made the sound of the impact hammer or drill. But thats it. The stream is useful for moving dirt or leaf clumps out of a corner or tough spot for angling the hose as the pulses will be enough to slide it slowly in the direction of the water spray. The thumb control lever works same way with water on or off just a smooth moving  lever.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2064,Awesome price and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,
2065,"Worked very well.  Fan is up and solidly installed.  For newbs like myself with their first install, you'll have to remove the two nuts holding the wire housing.  This will allow you to move the housing where you need along the length of the rod.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2066,Works good in my Ryobi Airstrike.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2067,Tool worked fantastic hundreds of clamps 0 leaks,,,,,,,,,,,,
2068,A great product.  Well worth the cost,,,,,,,,,,,,
2069,Stopped oscillation 45 days after purchase. Unless you have it turned the pressure EXTREMELY high it will not work properly. My front yard is not big enough to blast the sprinkler like that.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
2070,Simple device to use. Would be nice if it had a clamp remover built into the tool like a competitor does.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2071,Good quality nails at a great price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2072,I have had the c-clamps a week or so now and used them on a couple jobs so far. They work good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2073,"Nice heavy construction installs easily, the only thing I would have liked is a ground screw in the ground screw bump",,,,,,,,,,,,
2074,Love the grip these have !!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2075,Love It! Easy to use! Can move It easily to different locations.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2076,product not durable the orange grip came off of 5 of them. you have to help putting them back on i'm only using them for food bags and was clipped on the back of my patio chairs to keep them from falling forward when it rains but they keep popping off.update: 8/8 i was issued a full refund without requesting it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2077,Well constructed and sturdy and can be installed without attic access thru existing ceiling hole (or new one for that matter).,,,,,,,,,,,,
2078,"quality product great for use with ceiling fans, or heavy lighting fixtures.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2079,It has a excellent picture quality! We plan on investing in more ring products!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2080,Such beautiful colors. These will brighten up my patio and yard.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2081,"These clamps are absolutely wonderful.  I bought two and they have suited my needs 100%. The one-handed operation and the ability of the heads to pivot ever so slightly comes in handy with irregular shapes and surfaces when clamping. In addition being able to easily convert the clamp into a spreader is an added, and quite useful bonus.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2082,Meat little tool for cutting pled tubing. Straight cuts.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2083,"Worked perfect wit the nailgun I have for putting up some exterior trim. I had ordered it online and when it arrived the box was open and all nails loose in the padded envelope but this did not affect the function of the nails, just annoying.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2084,"The first thing I noticed about these were how well they are made. They have a good heft to them, and the craftsmanship is top notch (smooth all around, no jagged edges and sturdy). I had no problems attaching them to my hose, and no problems operating them. It was easy-peasy. They both have a comfortable grip and a good trigger sensitivity. My mom has arthritis and she found them easy to use, as they are comfortable to handle and don't require a lot of pressure on the trigger. I would highly recommend.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
2085,Works great for what its intended for. Only gripe is it doesn't come with a ground screw.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2086,"It seems to crimp ok. I have not pressure tested yet, but the adjustment screw fitting is too loose and so you can't get consistent crimping pressure, and it always slips back down to setting zero. Wouldn't purchase again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2087,These work fine in my Makita gun. No jams.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2088,Sprinkler does what it says and more.  I would recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2089,Kit had everything we needed screen was soft and sturdy easy to work with didn't tear. Made strong also used it to cover the vents for visiting critters! Live in the south and Pest control says when seasons change the big water bugs/spiders sometimes come through the vents... So to give my teenager peace of mind we lined the vents with this it was perfect!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2090,"After few month using it ( I have 3 units) is hard to change the different holes ,not a good product",,,,,,,,,,,,
2091,"Easy to use. It did bend a little bit while tightening, but held up to get the job done.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2092,Failed in 3rd year. Hard reboot no help. Have a second unit and doorbell cam that are still working so will probably blast another $250 to replace it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2093,Easy to install and works great!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2094,Works great. I would only wish for a longer cord.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2095,This tool has worked well for me as a beginner at using PEX. I like that this kit has the ring removal tool with it as well as the pex cutter. It also has the tool for testing crimps which works well since if doing a big job it is good to check and make sure you didn't miss any .,,,,,,,,,,,,
2096,"I bought this product instead of the doorbell so the light would illuminate the walkway and porch when someone came to my door at night, and the lighting also helps give a better night picture. It works well and is very inexpensive to save the videos. The batteries last several months. It comes with one battery, but you can purchase a second (it holds both at once) so it will still run while charging the depleted battery. It is also compatible with Alexa. Ring Spotlight Cam Battery",,,,,,,,,,,,
2097,Easy set up and easy to move. I do wish Lowe's sold extra batteries in the store,,,,,,,,,,,,
2098,"Very sturdy, and a good value.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2099,"Worked great, made a projects really easy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2100,"The cushion is BOTH THINNER AND NARROWER than I have come across in the past. It does not fit well on my standard lounge chairs (another example of the mis-fit is that the pads fit my zero gravity chairs with room to spar). Bought these because they were available, NOT because they were my first choice.Hence my mixed review. I would only recommend to friends with caveats, because they did end up being useful in an unexpected way.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2101,"Have used this kit a dozen times, works like a charm!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2102,Did not jam in the gun.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2103,Worked well raised ground terminal is nice,,,,,,,,,,,,
2104,Seriously had major issues with leaving my dog. I needed to monitor her craziness whenever i left. I was able to see and watch her and even save clips to show to the trainer and vet. And i talk to her her she gets anxious and it seems to help. Allot of these cameras are so expensive this one is simple effective and inexpensive. highest kudos to the company for putting out a real quality product easy to install and does what they say.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2105,"Great toilet we installed 2 and have been happy with selection. Easy to cleanness stays clean longer, great height and love the style. Highly recommend",,,,,,,,,,,,
2106,Perfect size for swing and loved the color,,,,,,,,,,,,
2107,Love it my nephew installed it and has worked perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,
2108,New design vs old work a whole lot better with new flow through tee im content with purchase.no stakes to keep ends from twisting whe water is turn on.gave it 4*,,,,,,,,,,,,
2109,"This is great. it has three different settings and is small, light weight and compact. when I tried it the water stream went at least 10 feet or more from where I was standing. For anyone who want something small and that will do the job this would be my recommendation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2110,They look awesome in our plastic outdoor furniture and really brighten it up. No sliding with the gripper bottom.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2111,"This toilet looks and functions nicely most of the time, but if it gets clogged you most likely will need to have it angered because it is impossible to get a good seal with a plunger. Delta designed the drain so deep and wide that there isn't a plunger on the market that will seal well with it, leaving air pockets to bubble out a disgusting mess everywhere when you plunge down. Terrible desig.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2112,"also has 2 stage flush option,push once for no. 1,push and hold for no. 2 complete flush",,,,,,,,,,,,
2113,"Great packaging, and great nails.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2114,"I bought this sprinkler because I have a odd shaped back yard and I am completely replanting it.  Anyway, I hooked this sprinkler up, and watched it as it sprayed near and far.  Then I tried to adjust it, and it was working for a little while, but then the twelve adjustment knobs started to turn with the sprinkler head.  This makes the adjustments acts of futility. Great idea, but still needs work.  I'm returning this sprinkler to Lowes.  It just did not work as designed. Not recommended!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2115,Very good product for price range anything more I would not buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2116,"I was installing a ceiling fan in our new home office when we found out that the current light fixture was being held by a brace that was not very secure.  When I went into the attic, I found that the previous brace was between two joists and not mounted onto a joist.  I thought I was going to need to buy a 2x4 and cut it into the exact size to make a sturdy enough beam to install a ceiling fan brace until I came across this life saver.  This ceiling fan brace was super easy to use, placed it above the hole of the ceiling fan location, and twisted the bar as the 2 sides extended.  Once extended enough, both ends have claws that dig into the joists. This product was a life saver, simple, cheap, and very easy to install.  Would highly recommend for anyone to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2117,Love that I can leave home and have the assurance that everything is safe and sound. My pets often set if the camera but I am glad that when they do I am able to get a notification and have a live view of my home. This was a great purchase for the price and I have since considered getting several more. Definitely a cheaper route to home security for those looking for something along that range,,,,,,,,,,,,
2118,"worked fine for a couple of days then it decided to stop moving. fooled around with it, cleaned it to no avail. cheap plastic junk",,,,,,,,,,,,
2119,Easy to use. Came in the box calibrated though it looks very easy to calibrate.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2120,"Screen was very easy to work with, and now my screened in deck looks great!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2121,Bought 6 of these sprinklers and all of them leak and they are a waste of money. Buy American,,,,,,,,,,,,
2122,This is a great camera that is very easy to set up and manage and I don't even need to pay for any monthly fees to still get some good value from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2123,Plastic inside easily break. Very very very bad design. Only 1 month use. Junk.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2124,"Easy to use. Connect a hose to it and stick it in the ground. It has adjustments on it for the distance of the spray and the density of the spray. Either turn the adjustment knob on the top or turn the screw in or out for the distance. You can adjust the aim of the sprayer by moving the collar around to a different position. It also has and additional hook up so you can connect multiple sprayers together. The sprayer covers about a 45 degree angle back and forth. All in all, it worked good.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
2125,works good to water flower garden,,,,,,,,,,,,
2126,Great product I highly recommend,,,,,,,,,,,,
2127,"it does not work, the knife was broken",,,,,,,,,,,,
2128,I bought two of these for my back yard - they both work very well and cover my two spaces accurately.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2129,"I put one on the hose in front of my house and the other on the hose in the backyard. Watering in the backyard is more complicated, and I use the one with different spray choices there. Both watering nozzles are working fine and both look good.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2130,"Limited life time warranty.  Whatever,  I lave to buy 4 to 6 of these every year.  $25 +- each time. At first, they are great,  soon after,  blade doesn't hold up.  I put in pool plumbing a lot, and only use it to cut new 2"" Pvc pipe schedule 40. But without a better option,  what can I do about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2131,Very good product. Reliable and strong.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2132,OVERALL THE BRACKETIS GOOD.  A LITTLE DIFFICULT ALIGNING THE BOX IN THE HOLE CUTOUT.  LONGER SCREWS WOULD MAKE THE TASK MUCH EASIER.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2133,nails performed awsome  no problems whats so ever,,,,,,,,,,,,
2134,Works great for its intended use. Don't crank too hard or use with super heavy objects and your golden!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2135,Yes we placed behind face of swamp cooler worked out well,,,,,,,,,,,,
2136,Worked well on 1 inch pex,,,,,,,,,,,,
2137,Easy to assemble and quick to connect and pair with wireless router. Awesome  quality day or night voice activation is an  awesome feature.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2138,"Super handy, super affordable way to bring a good amount of clamping force to bear on projects. Works well to push brake caliper pistons back into the calipers when doing a brake job",,,,,,,,,,,,
2139,I took out my old ones and installed the three new ones myself.  They were listed at $119 each and I am able to qualify for a reimbursement from my city government.  The additional cost was disposing of the old ones which was $19.  It took less then an hour to do each one.  Great work out as well packing them up and down my stairs case.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2140,Great junction box for ceiling fan. It's very strong and steady!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2141,Easy to install. Even a mechanically misincliend guy like me could do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2142,Didn't fit my door. The doors in my neighborhood have a facade over the front of the door (for style) and this caused the doorbell to just miss being able to connect to the backing. Also took forever to load up live-video during initial tests. Returned and got the Ring 3 instead,,,,,,,,,,,,
2143,This our second time purchasing this to use for screened porches. Adds privacy and helps block sun. Going to replace all the screens in our house with it!! Great product!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2144,This worked fine the first few times but now I noticed it leaks a little from inside the nozzle.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2145,"This is by far the best decision I've made this year. Perfect picture quality, feedback is great and the set up? A PIECE OF CAKE!! Beyond happy with my purchase!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2146,Great value for the money,,,,,,,,,,,,
2147,IT SAYS IT'S WIRELESS...IT'S NOT! Sent it back.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2148,"i bought these clamps to compliment my larger clamps.  They are a handy size and after a week of purchasing them, I needed them for a project.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2149,"DIstances wont adjust properly, some sections stay at the shortest.  Then it wont stay set and rotates all the way around shooting water in damaging places.  Complete garbage.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2150,Great product at a great price,,,,,,,,,,,,
2151,"Supposedly a screw releases the stationary jaw so that the trigger jaw can be slid off, reversed and the stationary jaw reattached in reverse.  The screw holding this in place has an impossibly tiny Phillips style slot.  My miniature driver set would not fit.  I notice that the photos here show a much larger Phillips slot.  And the information about this on the DeWalt site is worse.  They claim a push button release to convert this to a spreader, which is plainly incorrect.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2152,"Worked as advertised, easy to use",,,,,,,,,,,,
2153,This is the easiest sprinkler I have ever used. covers a lot of area and easy to set up and use. I ordered two More ! one for the garden and one for the side yard.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2154,Replaced two linked double switch boxes with this one.  Good solid box and lots of room to work.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2155,Poor spraying nozzle,,,,,,,,,,,,
2156,Love the size and quality for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2157,Used then a old house remodel. Fit the need of client and was a great added reveal. Only issue is cover requires a flat object to open. Which makes it a tad difficult.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2158,I laughed so hard at the review from the guy complaining that he had to widen the 4 inch hole to 6 inches in order to spin the whole assembly with box and all because it wouldn't separate.... Did he bother to notice the 4 undoable nuts inside the box meant to do just that- separate the box from the brace?                                      This item fit just right into the 4 inch opening.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2159,"The device does not work, Like others, first use it worked for about 15 passes. At this point it started watering my house, rocks and Christmas display. Picking it up and trying to stop it with my thumb, I can not see how they expect the tab to stop the head, my them almost could not stop the head and it clicked. I expected more from this company. For $9  is this worth me driving back, waiting in line and returning?  I crushed it and threw it in the trash where it belongs. Sorry, I am tired of wasting my time returning things and wasting my time. I would not recommend buying this. If you do, good luck.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2160,"Was easy to use, made it simple to cut the irrigation pipes right at ground level to splice in longer piping. It did not make a perfect cut but it was close enough to complete the job. 5 irrigation valves and ~40 1/2 pipes cut and its working fine. I would buy again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2161,"This product is easy to install and adjustable to fit your spacing. I used it to install an exterior light fixture on my metal garage, bracket is very strong. The total install time was about an hour, 2 screws is all I used to hold up the bracket and box. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2162,Wish the thumb control were longer. If water pressure is on the higher side longer handle would be better.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2163,Ordered to use outdoors and when received it is a NEMA-1 indoor enclosure so wont work. Checked numbers of item sent to website and they all match so bad website description,,,,,,,,,,,,
2164,Easy to use and I like the curved grip on the handle.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2165,"Overall, I'm satisfied with this sprinkler. It's used for watering my family's garden. It oscillates really well. It has a nice heavy base and stays in place. I wished it reached further, but it serves it does the job. I would recommend this water sprinkler for your garden.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2166,Yellow control tab broke within two weeks and after a couple of months another tab broke.  Today I noticed that the sprinkler was not praying evenly within the set spray area so much so that my grass was dying.  Buying something new to replace this junk.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2167,Can't say much about use but tool seems to be good quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2168,"I replaced a 10 year old sprinkler with this one the other day and man am I happy I did. This unit is super nice, easy to adjust, and seems really well built. The added benefit of the extra set of quick connect/disconnect connectors made it easy to put one set on my hand sprayer and the other on this and boom - quickly jump from one to the other with a simple crimp of the hose while I'm out in the yard. No more back and forth to the spout. Love it!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2169,Not sure what a $40 clamp can do that this one can't. I've done farmhouse table tops and cutting boards and it works great. I have Irwin pipe clamps to but alway use these because of the flat bar. I also like the way they sit on the workbench when clamped on my cutting boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2170,Very easy hook up and easy to use,,,,,,,,,,,,
2171,Nice and comfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2172,"This 4"" square, deep box worked great for my table saw switch upgrade. The wire clamp knockout holes worked perfectly and the box has plenty of multi-size knockouts.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2173,Easy to install and works great and looks great,,,,,,,,,,,,
2174,"Fit perfect, very comfortable!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2175,"Very strong. It will work very well on my back screen door. A bit difficult to install, maybe a slightly smaller spline would have been better.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2176,"It cuts, and rest assured, it is SHARP!BUT...The blade has a tendency to deflect and cut at a slight angle. The hinge point has too much play and allows for up to +-1mm along the length of the cut. Noy going to cause a leak on a crimp fitting, but may in a presure/shark/Jacob connector.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2177,"The Expert Gardener brand telescoping wand is the perfect accessory to have if you wash your vehicle yourself instead of going to a car wash, which is the primary reason I got it. The main advantages to using this wand when washing a car is the ability to control the water flow to a very very low rate, along with an adjustable water pattern spray. When rinsing the car with the very low water flow spray, with the pattern set to a wide setting, it really helps to prevent water spots on the car as compared to using a regular water hose with sprayer attachment. The telescoping action of the wand also allows you to direct the rinse water where you want it to go on top of the car without straining to reach those areas.In my experience, and this is with the hard water in Phoenix AZ, the water spots are almost eliminated on the vertical areas (the sides, the doors, etc) of the car after rinsing. Horizontal areas such as the hood and the top still need some towel drying though (I think you would need a mineral free water to help with that).The adjustable water flow is easily controlled with your thumb on the handle area of the wand. From zero flow to full pressure flow. Its a lever that is moved instead of a squeeze type control, so you can set it and not have to constantly hold it to maintain a desired pressure/flow. The wand length extends from about 27 inches, to a fully extended length of 42 inches. And the spray head at the end pivots, so you can have a rain like spray over an area from a distance.There are 10 spray patterns that can be selected, by turning the dial that is around the spray head. FLAT (which is my preference for low flow final rinse when washing my car), CENTER, JET, MIST, FAN, ANGLE, SHOWER, VERTICAL, FULL, and CONE.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
2178,"Not even half way through the summer and the little plastic control on top that turns the water on or off, popped off and water started squirting out everywhere, and the squeeze handle broke at the same time. I've been using this for 4 weeks and it's now useless.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
2179,The color is bright and gorgeous.  The fit is a little smaller than standard but it fits without too much gaping.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2180,These are nice and comfortable. They stay on the chair don't slide around. I've had to wash one so far it held up.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2181,Broke first time I used it on 1 inch clamps. OK for 1/2 inch only,,,,,,,,,,,,
2182,Would be a better unit if it was made of metal.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2183,I'm very happy with this screen and it performs exactly as expected. I had no problem installing it in my patio door screen even though it is stiffer than normal screen. My dogs made very short work of the normal screen I had replaced twice before and now after a few months my new pet screen is still in perfect condition. I should have done this a long time ago! I recommend this product to anyone having pets and screen doors and windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2184,"Terrible sprinkler not useful for anything.  I purchased 3 to water a new lawn.  They leak profusely where the plastic sprinkler shaft meets the metal spike, at the yellow extension outlet cap, and at the hose input (no matter how much you try to tighten. them).  I would give this product zero stars if available,  These things are only good for the trash; they simply do not work.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2185,"I almost took a trip to the store based on the description, but they clearly are not stainless steel as they are only for indoor use.  Very deceptive.  Change the description!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2186,Good quality for the price great for vibrant colors,,,,,,,,,,,,
2187,Works well but does tend to deform thin walled pipe.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2188,Chipped blade after a few times use. Save money and do not buy this product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2189,"They're nails. They hold pieces of wood together. I bought a box to attached the pickets on my fence and they worked just like I'd expect any nail to do. I did have a few issues with them not feeding, but that could be the nail gun. Overall, I'm happy and will buy them again the next time I need 2-in nails.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2190,"Was very difficult to seat on floor, had to purchase flooring to raise above flange in floor.  Looks like crap.  Does not have very good flushing power.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2191,"GOOD PRODUCT, WORKED VERY WELL, WOULD USE IT AGAIN...",,,,,,,,,,,,
2192,The hose connection pops off from the water pressure almost everytime.  Had it for 2 months and trashed it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2193,It is a screen. I can see through it pretty good. It will keep the bugs out if properly installed. Much better than the rusty old hole-filled ones that it replaced!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2194,"I received this product to review and it worked very well and cut thru the PVC pipe like Hot Butter with NO problems at all!The only ""negative"" comment I can think up is that this Kobalt PEX Cutter can be used for 1"" OD pipes only!If it was a little larger it could be used for more applications",,,,,,,,,,,,
2195,Well insulated box for my deck lights. Was very easy to install,,,,,,,,,,,,
2196,"Very sturdy screen for our 12' x `9' porch. I used the 36"" and the 48"" heights both 50' long and was very happy with the results. This will keep the three dogs from doing any damage. Phifer recommended the 0.140"" spline for use with this thicker screen, and I applied it to to a Screen-Tite system, also from Home Depot. Here is the finished result. I got better at putting the spline in as I went along, and the screens are very tight. View is not compromised during the day.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2197,"Great nails. Arrived quickly, worked great, good quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2198,I recently laid down some grass seed and I used this sprinkler to saturate the grass since it hasn't been raining that much. It worked great and hoping to see some sprouts pop up any day! It's also great for my son to play in when it's nice and warm outside. Great product that I highly recommend. It also seems super durable and will last a long time.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
2199,Great! Great price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2200,So far it works very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2201,"Very nice, especially for the price!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2202,"Works as described, no complaints. Would be nice if they had a washer on one end to secure the junction box from back spinning once in place. That would make it nice and solar and not let the junction box move. I still recommend, good product.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2203,"My old toilet was 1.6 gal. flush so now since I pay for water, I decided to go with a lower gallon flush toilet. The price was right for how it flushes! Whatever the advertisement says, that's exactly what it does! Great product!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2204,It did the job but WOW is this thing built cheap!I had to be careful to keep it straight as I cut the 1/2 inch pex.Really flimsy. It wouldn't surprise me if their cost on these things is about .99 cents!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2205,Very happy with the Kohler Elmbrook stylish & a flushing machine!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2206,VEry little coverage for 3 sprinkler heads. I had to cut out one of the heads just to get decent coverage,,,,,,,,,,,,
2207,Bostitch finish nails use them for all our projects.Yes I would recommend .,,,,,,,,,,,,
2208,It is very difficult to adjust the nozzle from spray to straight or direct spray. I also had to put  a new washer in the nozzle already.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2209,"Falsely triggers motion alerts all night long when cars pass my house. We've done all the suggested things (changing placement, activity zones, etc.) but it doesn't help. Feels like a huge waste of money.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2210,Does not always cut clean,,,,,,,,,,,,
2211,Reasonably priced and works very well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2212,Very satisfied with this product. I would definitely recommend it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2213,This is easy to install. However it comes folded and tears easily at the folds. Not durable at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2214,"These nails are a bit thin; more like box nails, but they do the job of fastening deck boards. They sure grab. I had one mis-fire that I had to remove. It was surprisingly tough. Overall I'm pleased.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2215,easy to use with one hand seems wobbly but good straight cut ratchet worked good have yet to try on pvc,,,,,,,,,,,,
2216,For the price it's one of the best,,,,,,,,,,,,
2217,Works beautifully made in the USA I had hoped but from China like everything else in Home Depot,,,,,,,,,,,,
2218,"This toilet came highly recommended. I purchased it and had a licensed Plumber install it. Shortly after having the plumber install it, it started running.  The water would stop and start like the toilet wasn't filling up. I called the plumber to come and look at it. The plumber replaced a part. Shortly after it started running again. It would start and stop, start and stop. Very annoying. I decided to call Kohler about their product. I was told by a representative that she would Fed-X me a part to replace in the toilet and she would send the instructions.  I'm a senior citizen and I purchased this toilet at the recommendation of the plumber, who stated this was the best toilet.  The Kohler rep said you could have a plumber come back and replace the part.  Yes, for a price!Kohler will send you the parts but doesn't pay for labor.  Beware of this toilet!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2219,Perfect. Sturdy metal gang box. Easy to install. Good coating for outdoor use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2220,you pay for what you get. Exceptional quality and it works.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2221,Comfortable seating. Easy to remember which button to use to flush. Saves water.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2222,As advertised - good material.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2223,it covers a large area - and my grandchildren enjoy it as well,,,,,,,,,,,,
2224,Excellent  choice for support for my fan...adjustable and easily installed,,,,,,,,,,,,
2225,Easy to install works well. Do have issues with link to door chime. Based on the instructions should be able to separate notification through chime. Does not work had to totally turn off.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2226,THey work well but the orange caps have come off after 3 weeks,,,,,,,,,,,,
2227,please secured the boxes before you ship for these brake apart during shipping,,,,,,,,,,,,
2228,"This is one of those products I didn't really know I needed. Most of the time I would just use a razor knife or hacksaw to cut small diameter pipes. The problem with that is the cuts are never straight and left burrs on the pipe which needed to be cleaned up or created a mess. It also took longer and was more dangerous with a knife.This cutter solves all of those issues. It cuts clean, fast and accurately. There are no burrs or mess. It saves a ton of time and is more accurate. I would highly recommend that even if you only cut a few pipes a year, it's worth adding this tool to your box. I should have gotten one years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2229,Everything you need in one package. A little difficult to install face plate because of the strong spring.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2230,Thought it would be heavier duty the small cat ripped it pretty easy. Had fiberglass on before no cat rips but grasshoppers ate it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2231,"I love my Gilmore Pro Cleaning hot water nozzle. This is a heavy duty sprayer, at least compared to other sprayers that I have had in this price range. I use it everyday to water my garden for a couple hours everyday. I have had other nozzles handles break off just from being dropped on the ground. But not this one, it puts up with my abuse and performs consistently. There is a adjustable spray pattern button and a rubber protector on the front. But I tore my rubber protector off and it is still going strong. If you are looking for a sturdy, reliable nozzle at a good price, buy this one, you will not be disappointed.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
2232,Pro desk Stephen wintermeyer Great service very professional,,,,,,,,,,,,
2233,Well packaged and shipped.  Not much to say about nails.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2234,Great color and very comfortable. Perfect for our patio deck chairs!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2235,So easy to hook up with the app. Works great. See the entire area. Works great with the wifi. Must plug in so have an outlet near by. I love it. Great Camara at a good price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2236,It doesn't work. Holding your thumb over the hose provides more pressure. One star is five too many.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2237,Very clear picture at night and during the day. You can use the speaker and actually hear very clearly all the sounds / voices in your space.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2238,"Hitachi not always our pick, but did a great job on our job.  No issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2239,Simple complete package. Everything needed for installation. This is an economical option that is very good quality. I purchased two and they both are working out well,,,,,,,,,,,,
2240,Easy to install. Very little effort. Built strong.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2241,It is good and it works well enough. I don't plan to have any long term use for it or even a big project. Price of $10 is money saver. Gets the job done and saves money. I can buy 3 or these for the cost of one of the regular duty cutters.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2242,"Easy to use, no issues with jamming or holding.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2243,Nice moderate rotation speed. Covers ground without any misses. Good product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2244,"Excellent nailer for reno's. Small enough to fit between studs 16"" OC. So far I fired about 1500 nails though it without issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2245,"easy to install, good quality, easy to move and connect. Very simple to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2246,"This tool does not work as advertised. I had two blades snap on me while trying to cut 1 1/4 PVC. Obviously, the product claims to be able to cut up to 1 5/8. I'm getting a refund and I implore anytime reading this to avoid purchasing this product.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2247,Toilet was easy to install with instructions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2248,"Expert gardener telescoping one has a10 pattern water flow head along with a telescoping wand for watering. Easily extends from 29"" to 43"".The wand locks in place with a twist of the handle. Nozzle head rotates 180 degrees for high planters, hanging flowers, trees, roofs, etc. Easy to change spray pattern. There are 10 different spray patterns from which to select (which may seem like is a bit much, but master gardener neighbor listed all sorts of scenarios this would be perfect for. From seeds to small sprouting to indoor to outdoor to patio planters to window boxes) the 10 spray patterns can meet plenty of needs! Control the water volume flow and shut off the water with your thumb on the handle. Wand does not leak or shake during use. I like the variety of flow options. It really is a gentle mist to one that can clean nature off a window.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
2249,Many sizes in the package good  for small repair jobs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2250,Buy them and buy more than you think you'll need. They're definitely worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,
2251,"This cushion seems to be well made and likely to hold up well.  However, it was also priced substantially over the cost of other cushions of similar quality found in the store.  I believe the material is a Sumbrella type that will not fade.  It is comfortable and cushy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2252,I purchased the indoor camera at the same time I purchased the outdoor one. These two cameras are amazing in quality and reliability. I can keep tabs on the house inside and out when I am gone both day and night.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2253,Good product at reasonable price,,,,,,,,,,,,
2254,Great price for such a quality camera. I use it in my garage and it works perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2255,I'm so pleased with the new cushions. They are exactly what I hoped for. Nicely made and fit well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2256,"This sprinkler seems to do the job. However, it is NOT heavy duty or weighted as the description says. It's flimsy plastic and the kind that probably breaks after a few uses. Returning before it breaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2257,"Quality nails, worked great on my first floor install, hickory 3/4 inch. The 5000 ct arrived in great shape.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2258,Clean cuts to Sharkbite products.  Easy to use. Durable construction. Having an exact tool made the repair easier for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2259,High Quality for the low price,,,,,,,,,,,,
2260,"Put on all three new hoses (purchased from local Home Depot). No leaking, excellent control of spray & volume, even for drip watering of new flowering tree.Would buy again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2261,Worked just fine. No issues,,,,,,,,,,,,
2262,Best clamps you can buy always have loved using Bessey clamps and doesn't break the bank to buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2263,I love this screen its sturdy and I just what I needed for the project I was doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2264,worked well for attic vents,,,,,,,,,,,,
2265,Don't expect square cuts on your pipes. These things can't cut straight. I regret buying them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2266,"We cleared an area of around 3000 square feet and put down grass seed. This sprinkler doesn't even cover half of it. I'm really disappointed because I bought two of them, one for another grassy area with a garden on each side that is only about 1500 square feet. It doesn't even cover that area. My old $9 oscillating sprinkler has better coverage. Don't waste the extra $$$ on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2267,Wow these are solid. My projects don't slide all over the place. Love the quick release,,,,,,,,,,,,
2268,Easy to install. Everything included except hose. Nice product,,,,,,,,,,,,
2269,Love these things they work very well,,,,,,,,,,,,
2270,"The nozzle reminds me of a fire hose end with a pullback type lever. Seems well made, sturdy, and hope it passes the drop test. Sprayed quite a ways when I tested it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2271,"Nice tool, works well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2272,"Photo shows it's on a roll. It's not. It's folded, so you can see the creases after it's installed. Also, screen tears way too easily.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2273,Toilet worked well but only lasted 2 years before water wouldn't shut off,,,,,,,,,,,,
2274,easily  cuts tubing . Like it,,,,,,,,,,,,
2275,"These are awesome. I bought the 3 pack, then bought an add on camera 3 weeks later. I love them. So easy to hook up, quality picture. I was a little hesitant to spend that kind of money, but this was by far the best option.ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼",,,,,,,,,,,,
2276,Worked well for my task.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2277,Comfortable and well made,,,,,,,,,,,,
2278,Some pliers are large and hard to use under cabinets. These worked great and seem very heavy duty.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2279,"I was so excited to receive these. They arrived and the quality was very nice. Unfortunately they are NOT 24"" but 22"" and did not fit my outdoor sofa. So disappointing.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2280,All types are previously opened.  Lowes just through them in a box all broken up.  Useless.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2281,"Easy to put on chairs, soft and supportive.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2282,"This nozzle is 100% fantastic. It seems strange to review a $10 hose nozzle, but this thing completely changed and improved how our hoses work. The water pressure improved. I don't know how, but it did. Zero leaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2283,"Leaks horribly no matter what I do, very disappointed.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
2284,Purchased three of these units to water a newly seeded area. One unit failed to oscillate after 16 hours of use. The second unit failed to oscillate after 30 hours of use. The third unit failed to oscillate after 42 hours of use.  IMHO - pure junk!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2285,works well in my ryobi cordless brad nailer,,,,,,,,,,,,
2286,These are really lite weight clamps for small projects Hope they perform well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2287,"Does the job, works smoothly with my Bostitch compressor nail gun with no jams.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2288,Very easy to work with,,,,,,,,,,,,
2289,The size I needed at a good price. And I didn't have to buy way more than I needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2290,Jet stream has excellent pressure and shoots out for a long distance. The shower setting is great for watering your garden gently without disturbing the soil too much.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2291,Works well and can be used in fairly small areas.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2292,"I purchased the pipe cutter to make my project easier.  It was perfect for the job - cutting 1"" electrical pvc pipe.  This tool worked great to get clean, straight cuts.  I would recommend this tool....",,,,,,,,,,,,
2293,Functions great! And easy to handle and use!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2294,"Worked well for construction of deck, nailing lumbar.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2295,"The description states they are 24"" x 24"" but in reality they are smaller. I picked them to replace original cushions, but now there is too much room on the sides and they slide around.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2296,"This is probably as good a plier type pex cutting tool as you going to findâ€”very sturdy (all metal) and well made. That said, it suffers from the same deficiency that all of these tool designs doâ€”it takes some degree of skill to achieve a perfect right angle cut when it should not have to. Firstly, when you lay the pex run atop the cradle or bottom jaw of the tool, you are placing it on a smooth open sweeping surface that really offers no buttressing or guide positioning. So you must hold the length of pex perfectly still at a precise right angle against the cradle surface. Secondly, as you squeeze the handles and the blade begins to bite down on top of the tubing, the tool begins to try to pull the pex at an oblique angle, potentially jeopardizing the integrity of the cut. After a few practice tries, I was able to achieve a fairly decent square cutâ€”not perfect, but close. This tool could greatly be improved with the addition of some type of half pipe channel guideâ€”perhaps an inch or so long that was the same as the O.D. of the pex and attached to either side of the bottom jaw at right angles. That way, you could feed the tubing into the channel where it would be held in place. When you then squeezed the jaws, the tubing would be held fast, and would have no ability to wiggle or shift position, thereby yielding a perfect and precise right angle cut every time with no possibility of error. This, in my opinion would be a tremendous improvement to this type of tool with minimal redesigning. Are you listening Milwaukee?",,,,,,,,,,,,
2297,Excellent quality. Attractive color ( gray).  Comfortable to sit on. I would buy again,,,,,,,,,,,,
2298,"Beefier, heavy , solid. Like the grips and doesnt take much to tighten.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2299,When I got it nails was out of the package nails was loose in evelope,,,,,,,,,,,,
2300,"good price, good product",,,,,,,,,,,,
2301,The screen was easy to work with to re- screen in my porch. Looks very nice!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2302,Great water sprayer for the price! Highly recommend!! We have now purchased a second one! Quality product!!See more,,,,,,,,,,,,
2303,It is easy too use. Got the job done. Afforded me the ability to do some nicer upgrades in my house.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2304,Worked well with the guns I boughtStrong good product,,,,,,,,,,,,
2305,"Package was broken and nails out and broken up, useable but a pain",,,,,,,,,,,,
2306,I was able to hold several pipes in the device and easily cut all.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2307,Bought this toilet and the salesman said it was very good.  Nothing but issues.  Plugs super easy due to getting airlocked. Toilet was installed by a professional plumber.  Plus randomly even with only being used to urinate in.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2308,"If I could give this a zero rating I would.I bought this product last October. Setup was easy, and the product worked pretty well. Audio is terrible, and range is limited. The unit I bought had the module for local storage, which I wanted because I wasn't interested in cloud storage.About a week ago the product stopped recording videos, and became a simple motion detector. Blink is now telling me I need to pay $3/month to record videos stored locally on a module I already paid for. Total ripoff. Look elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2309,"Simple screen, but not good quality. Going to wait for the pets to put some more holes, then do this _extremely_ loosely so the screen doesn't tear in the middle... again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2310,Fantastic tool.  Works great.  Always check adjustment . Read instructions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2311,Excellent small clamp,,,,,,,,,,,,
2312,Liked its sturdiness of item. Gave good coverage.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2313,Great toilet! Sleek and works well. I've bought 4 and am very pleased. I paired them with the kohler flusher in brushed bronze and they look gorgeous,,,,,,,,,,,,
2314,When its fully powered on its captures phenomenal quality but dont like to have the battery drain in less than 24hrs. Purchased the ring solar hoping to charge 100% during daylight and maintain powered at night. Nope it doesnt do the job! Based on the reviews through ring community this is a known issue because of the recent software. Unfortunately have to return this to get the wired version as this is more reliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2315,Kit included everything I needed to repair my screen at a low cost. Everything worked well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2316,Nothing fancy but they work just fine and were an economical choice. Using them to allow us to get more fresh air in the house for those rare occasions when someone else comes in.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2317,"I bought three of these and two so far has fallen apart with no way to put them back together again. I don't know if they were glued together or what, but the main part just fell off of the base.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2318,"I would prefer the cushion to be firmer; however, overall, it is comfortable and the color is very nice. Also, cushions fit the chair well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2319,"I was surprised at the quality and price for these clamps. I was looking for a couple of traditional C-clamps, but found this 4-pack of quick-grip clamps giving me something far better.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2320,No it has to be returned I don't have Wi Fi to use it. But I'm sure it would have worked fine if I could use it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2321,This toilet stays clogged more than you can use it I've had it for a year now and regret it didn't think much of it seen one two weeks after I bought this one sitting in the alley now I know why it clogs every time you expect it to not to clog and at the worst of times it acts like it's got some kind of valve mechanism built into it The worstest thing is you cannot find a plunger that fits it to plunge it very much do not recommend very displeased with itAlso has a problem with allergy buildup,,,,,,,,,,,,
2322,This was recommended to me by my sliding glass door contractor. It's amazing! Looks great and my animals don't tear it. Much easier on the hands than aluminum too.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2323,"These are decent clamps for panel glue ups as long as the boards are well prepared. You are not going to get a lot of pressure out of them, but they do their intended job for a reasonable price. Use some Loctite on the cap nuts on the handle and tighten them before use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2324,First time I've used one with a lever activated handle. Much easier to use than a trigger and don't have to squeeze it constantly to get it to workVery nice concept.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2325,Love it. Great quality. Color is closer to grey than brown.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2326,Works fine but not tall enough. I was told that it was much taller than it is. It came in a box and I never saw it until the plumber installed it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2327,Worked fine in Ryobi nail gun,,,,,,,,,,,,
2328,I like it. Works great,,,,,,,,,,,,
2329,Love the colour & thickness of cushions. Great purchase!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2330,This was amazing quality and the instructions are very easy to follow. I highly recommend this brand!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2331,"Very solid box. Just wished they had no pre-stamped knockouts. I needed to create a 3/4"" knockout and this isn't the box for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2332,"One of the wheels was broken.  Need to send it back.  After reading all the reviews,  I want to get refunded",,,,,,,,,,,,
2333,"beware if you pull the screen taut it will rip , screen needs to be stronger",,,,,,,,,,,,
2334,"After a recent storm that took out some screens I was going to have a screen company come out and replace all the screens on my home, but I decided to try this method first and see how I did. I was a little intimidated, but it was a lot easier than I thought it saved me a lot of money by paying a company to come out and redo all my screens after a recent storm. The end product turned out great! Hopefully these will last a couple years. Quality seemed great out of the box. Let's hope they hold up.Tip: I ended up needing a lot of this to do 30 or so windows, and I probably could've measured better, but I ended up with a lot of waste or weird screen sized scraps. Only con is how long it takes to do so many screens, but the product is great so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2335,The best clamp for what we needed so glad I came across this beauty nice two tone color really shows up on our work  thanks husky,,,,,,,,,,,,
2336,"I was skeptical of the 1.28 gal/flush, but my contractor recommended this toilet and it was also highly rated by Consumer Reports.  With a whole-house remodel, I purchased three of them.  After several weeks of use, they all work flawlessly.  The flow rate is sufficient to remove all the waste with one flush.  Although the specs state 12"" rough-in, this will also fit in an 11"" rough-in space, so check your measurements.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2337,"This was very easy to install by myself (60+ woman), no issues with getting the screws in for the cover. My only issue is that it doesnâ€™t close completely. I wonder if Iâ€™m not seeing a catch or something? I bent a piece of wire to hold the cover to the inside area to hold it closed for now. Any suggestions?",,,,,,,,,,,,
2338,Fast easy setup and install. Love the zone control.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2339,Used to cut leaking ABS pipe in hard to access ceiling area. Worked far better than anything else. Have used since and works without any problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2340,"Who sends 2500 nails like this. Now iu have to worry about rust, broken paper for ease of loading. .. horrific . Ship from Amazon. .they are losing there appeal lately. Very unhappy they should held responsible and mail me something I can store these..wanna bet they done even care about you.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2341,"Could not use a standard set up as too many things in the way, this box worked perfect. Solid in place",,,,,,,,,,,,
2342,Image quality is excellent!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2343,Love them. They fit the chairs well and are very comfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2344,"works great, but it's get light. you really need to make sure it's placed properly before walking away and letting it water your grass. other than that it's a good product",,,,,,,,,,,,
2345,Great product! Tough and durable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2346,It works perfect specially on quick repairs,,,,,,,,,,,,
2347,These are good quality at a decent price. Have used this brand for many years,,,,,,,,,,,,
2348,I have 2 houses and in a year have purchased 8 of these. I prefer the single flush on the side which is available. Also the seats are not soft close. I like them because they are a STEAL for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,
2349,Best value I could find and not a single jam up for the whole 2 boxes. Will def buy again!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2350,I use several of these throughout my home. They work great for monitoring my children who are watched in my home as well as baby monitors in their rooms. I also like them for piece of mind and security.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2351,Those worked well with Brad nailer.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2352,"Just a notice that these are large clamps 12"" length. They work great for woodworking or carpentry.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2353,Great value and product. Set up was easy to understand,,,,,,,,,,,,
2354,"Great Product, uses less water with a strong flush.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2355,"Setting up is as easy as setting up the indoor nest. Love the magnetic mounts they made it super easy to install. I placed one on a tree and painted it camo, taped up the glass with some frog Tape, as well as the speaker/microphone, QR code, and serial number. They blend in really well to the environment and look amazing. Quality of video is excellent after placing mesh satellite outside!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2356,"Purchased two of these and had to return one because a micro leak.  One was perfect the other continued to leak despite multiple changes of the internal components.  Returned defective unit and have not had issue with the third.  Flushes well, but is a different feel than the low flow multi button option I had in prior home.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2357,Motion tracking does not work which defeats the purpose of the pan/tilt vs the regular wyze cam.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2358,"This sprinkler is perfect for my small garden spot. I didn't want to use my full size lawn sprinkler because it would waste too much water. Many reviews here spoke about it didn't cover much area. Please read the description. It say MINI sprinkler. The amount of watering time is reduced because the area is so specialized. This will provide excellent coverage for my vegetables it remained stable during the watering process. It didn't ""walk"" from the water pressure. I highly recommend if your need is a small space . Don't expect it to cover your entire yard.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2359,Good size and works perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,
2360,"This BetterVue Insect Screen is easy to see thru & keeps bugs out. One must be careful when replacing the screen as it is pretty fragile. I took my time putting the spline & screen in the old frames. Luckily, I did not rip the screen as I will leave that to my cats. It is nice to be able to open the windows once again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2361,"As another person already mentioned, this toilet has had to be reinstalled three times to try to troubleshoot leaks.  Super inconvenient so we are going to replace it after only 3 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2362,great product and price,,,,,,,,,,,,
2363,Quality Product :-),,,,,,,,,,,,
2364,works Great!! and not that expensive,,,,,,,,,,,,
2365,Easy to use . Very durable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2366,Ideal kit to replace your damaged screen on your patio sliding door! I have material left to replace my screen again or fix a couple window screens. Easy to use. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,
2367,These finish nails were the right length to use on my project.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2368,worked perfect for my nail gun,,,,,,,,,,,,
2369,Product worked well. had no problems. delivered quickly,,,,,,,,,,,,
2370,"This toilet flushes very well, isn't super loud and is very easy to clean.The one downside is that this toilet is NOT compatible with really any bidet I've tried, for two reasons:1. The bowl curves inward very close to the back of the toilet seat, which blocks the bidet spigot from opening2. The toilet set curves downard near the back of the toilet seat, which blocks the body of the bidet from entering the toilet bowl.I love the toilets but am seriously disappointed in the lack of bidet compatibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2371,"As a Do It Yourselfer I consider these to be a great buy! Same features as the expensive brands. Well made, very sturdy! Easy to use! Highly Recommended!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2372,This works well for the water lines i replaced no need to spend big on a tool for pex water lines this works perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,
2373,I have one for the front lawn and one for the back lawn. Great coverage.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2374,"Hard to control, maybe will return it",,,,,,,,,,,,
2375,"was redoing my joints on my truck, an needs a extra hand they worked perfectly",,,,,,,,,,,,
2376,"It's ok, i mean its a sprinkler.... but its a little too light weight so it can move around while in use. And the knob you turn to control the direction the water shoots out is poorly marked.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2377,Every had a product show up and it's completely destroyed? Nails broke out of the factory banding? boxes in pieces? Well this is what u wanna order if that's what ur looking for. Trash. They didn't even try to secure it at all. Heavy. But why not do some sort of support,,,,,,,,,,,,
2378,It looked better online.  The material on the seat looked like it wouldn't last long and looked cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2379,Good quality and pretty ta boot,,,,,,,,,,,,
2380,I bought two. one never even oscillated. the second oscillated less than 30 minutes before getting stuck. tried troubleshooting tips suggested by others with experience and it just wouldn't oscillate again. returned both. it's trash,,,,,,,,,,,,
2381,Works every time. Cuts with no problem with the thickest piece of pic.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2382,Work great for wall floor boards. I used this for an at home project which definitely made life easier. I would purchase again and recommend to others.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2383,"Perfect color match for my project, plenty of room to make connections",,,,,,,,,,,,
2384,Worked great.  Battery lasted the whole job with plenty to spare.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2385,"Seat cushions are not that sturdy and even though they look thick, they sink to the chair seat rails. For the price, meh!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2386,I would have given it 5 stars if there was a knockout in the back. We do secure to the wall with raintight connections.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2387,I waited as long as I could to replace my old water-hogging toilet. This new one uses only a fraction of the water as the previous one and functions so much better. Wish I had replaced this sooner!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2388,"good material, and easy to instal",,,,,,,,,,,,
2389,Great look and great quality. Color is exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,,,,,,
2390,This clamp is by far the best clamp that HF has to offer. Smooth operation makes it quick and easy to keep things square.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2391,The kits worked perfectly and were very straightforward to assemble.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2392,"After checking Reviews from different suppliers I picked this one based on the price and decent reviews. It is working fine so far but it remains to be seen how long it keeps working fine without any dripping. The price you pay for this, it seems to be a good Nozzle",,,,,,,,,,,,
2393,Good quality and very easy to install!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2394,Worked great and holds tight.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2395,I wish the flow patters were more refined. All around Well built product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2396,Simple to install and very durable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2397,Super comfortable well made love that's two peices I can rotate the cushions so it doesn't get a bum spot and one cushion.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2398,Seemed solid but stopped oscillating after 4 months.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2399,Bessey clamps are always my go to for wood working. Superior clamp strength for holding material down and materials together. They are worth the money.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2400,"Quick and easy to use, holds solid without slipping.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2401,I purchased two Kohler toilettes and both had cosmetic defects.  I would return them and reschedule their installation or accept them as is and keep on schedule.  I had little choice but to accept them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2402,This box does the job and it's a reasonable price.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2403,"I tested this cutter on some spare PVC pipe and I was very impressed with how easily it cut through the pipe and how smooth a cut it made. In the past I have used a hack saw which then required additional sanding to smooth edges but this leaves a great cut. I would expect it to cut through a rubber hose just as easily. The additional included metal pipe cutter is suitable for soft metals (copper, aluminum etc) but I would not try it on steel.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2404,They don't last any of them so why pay moreSee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
2405,"A very good wired security light system with video and audio and storage. Not to mention the helpful (real) people who provide assistance if needed, efficiently and promptly.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2406,"This is a great sprinkler. I love that it has so many different settings, it's perfect for watering a variety of plants, grass, and even running through!!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2407,"I love the thumb control.  My favorite part of one of these is the ""jet"" spray and this one is closer to being ""full"" and a bit disappointing.  It works but not as good as I really wanted.  Altogether this is a very nice component to watering the plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2408,"I've have always used a hack saw for pvc cuts for my small projects. I was disappointed that some of the cuts of mounted vertical pipe were crooked so I decided to buy this cutter due to the positive reviews. I used it on a small plumbing project. ~ 10 cuts, 1"" schedule 40 pvc. It worked great. All nice straight cuts. I highly recommend this cutter. I'm glad it's in my tool box ready for the next project.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2409,"I used this product for mounting a Ring Floodlight Camera. It worked perfect, and the white color matched the house's exterior.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2410,Excellent product and service,,,,,,,,,,,,
2411,This worked perfectly for my living room window. I installed it on to the outside of the window frame however it was challenging to install from inside the apartment (I'm on the 12th floor so I can't install it from the outside). Now that its installed it's perfect! It has a great hold and seals all the way around to keep bugs out. Very happy with this screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2412,I've only had them for a month but they are working out well. They are not as thick as I would like but they are comfortable. Especially if you need narrow cushions. They are the best thickness I could find for the size cushion and they were half the price of some lower quality cushions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2413,Easy to cut all pvc piping. Mark the dimensions make the cut,,,,,,,,,,,,
2414,Super great cushion at a great price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2415,"As expected, solid and high quality, no disappointments !",,,,,,,,,,,,
2416,Thick and comfortable,,,,,,,,,,,,
2417,"Needed a new balcony screen that was bug proof bc of our woods. As you can see from my pictures it does do the job. However, there are still small gnats or some kind of bug that makes it inside. I had the spline from my other screen that was on already. So, I did order new, but when I took it out it was toi old to reuse, so I recommend just buying new spline. Otherwise,you may just end up running up to the local hardware store while in the middle of the project & hoping they have the size & color in stock. Screen seems solid and looks like it'll hold up. Shipping was quick and I would definitely buy from this seller again. Just make sure to measure 2x. The product I bought was actually ""bug screen"" the same as what is in all my windows, but these darn small gnats can still get through. ANNOYING!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2418,The nozzle has 7 different patterns and each setting has a distinct flow of water. You can choose from a full stream of water to a soft mist. The contoured handle fits nicely in your hand and is lightweight. There is a lock on clip that provides a continuous stream of water. Jet spray has enough pressure to clean away debris. Used the jet spray on my car when washing and no damage to the paint on the car. Works well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2419,Very easy install! Works great. American standard lasts for a lifetime,,,,,,,,,,,,
2420,Paslode nail systems work so well. if you have lots of renos to do this is the product for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2421,"These clamps are very strong, too strong. Almost unusable as my fingers hurt or get pinched as I try to use the clalmps.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2422,The mesh tears easily and the price is too high.The tool is plastic and falls apart easily. The spine cord is garbage. It's very flimsy and doesn't stay in the groove. Phifer needs to work on some quality control if you ask me.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2423,Works great no issues,,,,,,,,,,,,
2424,"I received the Expert Metal Pistol Nozzle and was happy to try it out. According to my husband, one can never have too many water hose nozzles! The metal type is his favorite as it holds up to being dropped and holds up better in the weather. We live in a dry part of Texas and growing grass is extremely challenging. He likes being able to stand on the porch and have a nozzle that will spray across the front yard. He prefers to water the grass using a nozzle because I have lots of bird feeders which do not need to get wet. The nozzle is easy for him to control and adjust to the stream he needs. He also washes his truck once a week. The powerful stream comes in handy during the seasonal love bugs. It also has threads on the end of the nozzle so he can attach his power wand. Plus it has a built-in trigger lock.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
2425,"great little camera, have a total of 4 of them and they have a clear picture, once and a great while i cant get one to show video on phone but other than that no problems at all. Like I said I have 4.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2426,"Not what I expected,  even better.  Fit the chairs perfectly.  Very much satisfied",,,,,,,,,,,,
2427,Works well with the nail gun that we bought. Good price for amount of nails you get.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2428,looks and works great,,,,,,,,,,,,
2429,Love the color and comfort,,,,,,,,,,,,
2430,Super easy to install.  Really well built.  Highly recommend it if you need to hang a ceiling fan or heavier light fixture.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2431,"Feels nice, very strong holds.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2432,This worked well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2433,"Seems to work well, first time using pex, and it surprised me how well this works for the clamps. And it's one of the cheapest one I've found.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2434,Very nice quality tools and clamps. Use ut the day it arrived. Worked great,,,,,,,,,,,,
2435,"The camera night vision is very bad, you can barely see the babyâ€™s movement. Also, motion detection is slow as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2436,"I have ran about ten clips through a new nail gun, no issues with feeding. Works well going into pressure treated lumber.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2437,Did what I needed it for and is a good quality material,,,,,,,,,,,,
2438,"Ok for windows, but not sturdy enough for screen doors",,,,,,,,,,,,
2439,"I purchased these to use as out-facing cameras due to the fact my condo association does not allow outdoor cameras. I'm sure these are great for indoor use! These serve my purpose during the day, even though looking through the window screens doesn't give a crystal-clear picture. But, forget it at night, as soon as it gets dark, all you see is bright light. The reflection bouncing back off the window means you do not see ONE thing outside. But, they are probably a great crime deterrent as a...",,,,,,,,,,,,
2440,"I hate watering the sidewalk and street, and this sprinkler hit the nail on the head in its ability to water odd shaped yards. Its comparativly expensive, so i hope it lasts more than a couple of years.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2441,Worked great n didnt jam at all! Worked better than bostitch nails,,,,,,,,,,,,
2442,Very poor quality. Cushions are already sunken in and unable to provide any support. Regret my purchase!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2443,I just purchased my Nest cam and I love it. It does what I want it to do and more. The only thing I was dissatisfied about is the 2 way communication on the camera is delayed too much.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2444,"Fed without any issues, quality appears very good. Use to install 250' of wood fence boards. No regrets.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2445,"Very cheap, light plastic. There is no way this will even last staking it into the ground here in WA with our rocky soil. So disappointed!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2446,Value for money was great. Exactly what I needed for my new nail gun. Thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2447,"This product does not tear when my 10 lb. cat claws and climbs on it in my slider doors, which is wonderful. The horizontal piece does move, though, so I periodically slide them back up to keep the spaces at a better size to keep insects out. My handyman installed it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2448,They do what they're supposed to. No jamming.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2449,Looks nice and way to install for a DIY project.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2450,Nice hose nozzle. Seems solid and works well,,,,,,,,,,,,
2451,Worked great will buy again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2452,"This screen is easy to cut, make sure you have enough and if you have extra left it is ok save for the future use",,,,,,,,,,,,
2453,Super easy to use seems to be OK I cannot comment on the durability as I've only had about one month but I would buy this product again,,,,,,,,,,,,
2454,"It's been said that you can never have too many clamps and I would agree with that. You also need to have the right clamps. I can't say how well these will work if you need a lot of clamping pressure because I use them as an extra set of hands to hold things together during assembly mostly with wood screws. HF bar clamps with screw adjustment work great for most glue ups and for those really high pressure situations I use pipe clamps. But if you're looking for a clamp to hold pieces securely in place while you drill / counter sink / screw, etc. these work great.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2455,"I've been using Paslode guns since 1991 and I've never had any complaints.  They work well and with the recommended application of oil they very rarely jam.  Consequently I stick with Paslode nails and, again, no complaints.  They fire clean and set predictably.  No jams to speak of.  The glue is heated by the friction of penetration and holds effectively.  Pricing seems reasonable.  I've never seen Paslode galvanized nails rust or leave streaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2456,Best product for this price,,,,,,,,,,,,
2457,Performed exactly as I needed it to.  Used for shower drain that I needed to cut below grade.  Surprisingly easy to control and get a straight cut.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2458,"I bought it to keep an eye on my puppy, it's great. Captures a wide area of space, you can zoom into the video, I can hear what's happening in the home and speak to my pup. It was a very easy install process.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2459,"I use these to clamp my wood to my worktable when using a jigsaw to cut. It makes me feel so much safer than holding the wood with my hand. They are very easy to use, and clamp plenty strong.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2460,"Works perfectly..., for what it is designed to do.  Height is perfect for older people with wimpy knees.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2461,I like this clamp set because the smallest clamps actually hold things. I've bought other versions on amazon and they have they barely hold anything. I work with LED strips and I need a snug (not tight) hold to keep them in place while I work on other sections of the lights. These are strong. I just wish they would sell the small ones alone. I hate that I have to buy a set of larger ones that I don't need just to get what I want. All good though.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2462,The only reason I gave this 4 stars was that the installation took forever. I am not super handy when it comes to stuff like this. The tool that it came with for the screen to fit into the gaps of the window screen was not useful at all.. it didn't even fit into the gap. I had to use my nails to basically squeeze it in..,,,,,,,,,,,,
2463,Very low pressure nozzle.   Normal water pressure slightly focused.   Cheaply made.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2464,Good sturdy clamps,,,,,,,,,,,,
2465,Apparently if your water pressure is over 30lbs this nozzle can't handle it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2466,Great ability to customize width/depth of spray and flow. The only improvement might be to add a little weight in the base to increase stability.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2467,The price was great and the quality was excellent. It was strong enough to do the job I wanted. Everything I buy here is top quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2468,Kit had everything I needed. A set of instructions was clear and very helpful. This is a great product to have on hand for quick home repairs. Love it!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2469,Easy to set up and use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2470,"As others noted, the template is not big enough to get things to fit. We went into the install knowing that but still did not compensate enough and had to do some adjusting after the hole was done. There is VERY little room around the hole to screw the cover into the floor so hopefully you are not off too much. The cover is almost impossible to open. Used the tip in one review about covering a flat head screw driver with electrical tape but still hard and still marked the cover up. Can't imagine doing that very often and still having a good looking cover. I must admit that I am happy with the look compared to the open hole we had from an old floor plugin that was removed years ago but that is about it!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2471,Good toilet. Easy to install. Only took off one star because the flush buttons are flimsy and feel cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2472,Excellent product! The view and airflow are great and the screen was easy to work with and install. The Product t appears to be well made and durable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2473,Junkâ€¦just like all of Home Depot's outdoor cushions. Not worth the money they're charging,,,,,,,,,,,,
2474,"These work great! Amazing product for the price, very good distance and coverage.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2475,"This Apollo pex pinch clamp tool saved me many hours on my plumbing project, great tool anD yes I highly recommend it others",,,,,,,,,,,,
2476,Great product. Easy to set up. Adjustable for the area you want to water.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2477,Better than expected. Good value for the price. We'll see how they hold up in the hot southern CA sun.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2478,The material was of poor quality. It started ripping immediately.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2479,"Like most Texans, Valetines day was just a disaster. Pipes busted and toilets were damaged. As soon as stores were open, there were long lines and shelves were empty. Fast forward a week, I had to replace two toilets and luckily I found this gem and it came with everything. When I say everythinng, I mean everything. Wax, bowl internals all came with the toilet and it was so easy to install. Directions were easy to read and it took more time hauling the old one out. Definitely a great buy! Also if your toilet wobbles becausebits not flat on the floor, you have to use wedges because your floor isn't leveled. Use pennies, thats what I was told.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2480,Moved into a house with no ceiling lights in the bedrooms.  Used 3 of these working from the attic.  Easy to assemble and all hardware is provided.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2481,They hold and work great,,,,,,,,,,,,
2482,It is an excellent camera. I watch my dog while in out and it can't see at quite long distance from the back to the front door. Highly recommend. It can also be monitored 24/7 for $30 a year.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2483,"Arrived on time, carefully packaged and worked well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2484,Have a short term rental that the renters walked through the screen. Did a good job on replacing the torn screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2485,Works as advertised. Quality of picture is crystal clear,,,,,,,,,,,,
2486,Works just as good as a high priced one.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2487,"Tired of buying the same products over and over again at local big box store. This is a great sprinkler, throws water far and has good distribution, does what it should. Nice solid metal base and I like the method for setting the range, easy to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2488,Needed adiustable temporary screens and these fit the bill!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2489,Great Item! Great Price!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2490,"Easy to set up, great picture quality. Notification of movement detected is great feature.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2491,10 inch rough in - fit nicely.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2492,"It serves a purpose, not well. Flimsy , and not easy to size perfectly as needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2493,Very nice device that does everything as promised. It connected to our network easily and was easy to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2494,"My kids ceiling fan almost fell completely out of the ceiling about a week after moving into our new house. The original plastic box in the ceiling had stripped out screw holes, so having the fan on high wiggled them loose. I bought this as an upgrade and replacement. Instructions were straight forward and installation was very easy. This was my first time replacing one of these. I'll probably have to do the other room as well, since the fan appears to be doing the same thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2495,"Easy to install and link to. Great picture quality, zoom, and sound. A great value and sensible investment. Totally cool! Coolgle!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2496,Well built sprayer. Solid and easy to use,,,,,,,,,,,,
2497,Cuts through Pex really easy.  Made the job so much easier.  Highly reccomend,,,,,,,,,,,,
2498,Used these to cut Sharkbite brand 3/4 water pipe. They cut the pipe about 10 times with no issues. I believe they did start to dull by the end. I installed a whole house water filter and water descaler using sharkbite connectors and tubing. They worked fine for me. It was a little hard to get a straight cut. Using those connectors the pipe needed to be cut straight. They seemed to work fine for the price. I bought them for that one job. I can't see a pro using them everyday tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2499,"Under the Product information this product is listed as ""Stainless"". These brads are NOT stainless.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2500,"Remodel the whole house and this was a perfect fit .  Installed myself, went great!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2501,Installed easily and was great for the job.  Hung the ceiling fan without problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2502,These little guys work great. Do not slip or mark up wood,,,,,,,,,,,,
2503,"Great clams, very pleased with the ease of use and flex ability .. I will buy more !!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2504,It's a good quality pex cutter up to 1in. I recommend it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2505,"A lot of false motion detections, after reviewing the detections, the video starts in color and you hear a click after 3 seconds and goes to black and white picture and nothing happened to trigger the motion detection. Way to many and all false. The color is outstanding that's about the only thing besides the price. I guess you pay for what you get. Igave this review a one star for motion detection because you don't have an option for to give zero stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2506,This is a cheap nozzle that broke after a few weeks of use. You might get one whole summer of use out of it.If you want something more durable I recommend not buying this.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2507,It's great! Works so well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2508,"I was able to install without having to go in the attic.  Once install, very strong.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2509,"As the info states, the tool is pretty much a one handed operation. You have to be very careful to make sure the jaws are seated properly on the pinch area of the clamp. In tight spots, that can be difficult. One of the first crimps I made was where I could not see the crimping end of the tool and it did not crimp properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2510,"This is the second order of these clamps that I have made. They are good, sturdy clamps but in the second order that I received today one of the small clamps were missing. Hence the title. Overall though, I would recommend these clamps.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2511,This is my first time trying this style but I like the idea of not having to hold the handle grip down when watering. I like the spray options.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2512,I replaced two American Standards that had broken tanks after two years of light use. The Kohler units work great and were very easy to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2513,"This cushion is good if you are looking for firmness. The cushion is thick and firm.  It seems well made, but I was hoping for a softer cushion.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2514,"These are clamps - they seem like they'll hold up adequately. There's a lot of clamping force and they open smoothly.That said, there was a ten smackeroo remuneration associated with constructive criticism, so these clamps cost nothing and have useful value. Can't lose.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2515,"What a great product! I had three ""cheaper looking"" but more expensive sprinklers from other companies malfunction, one after another. I was very discouraged until I got this one. This one is sturdy and stable. Furthermore, the spray is just right. It works perfectly!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2516,"This works only if your ceiling joist is more than 3"" high. If your 2x4 joist has wide side facing down, the brace has no place to grip on 1.5"" side, so the brace will essentially be held up by ceiling drywall only. It would be helpful if they mention this in the packaging. I had the impression that this will work on any ceiling joist when I read the package. I had to return this and get the pancake box, which works on any kind of joist and costs way less.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2517,This sprinkler is not only easy to use but I will be able to water my lawn in half the amount of time due to the area it covers. I am so thrilled with the purchase of this product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2518,This screen is amazing (I chose black).  Cats can't do any harm to it.  It is really simple to install (if you take your time) and it is tight as a drum to this day.  My project (screen door) required using .125 dia. spline and all went very well.  Excellent product and inexpensive enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2519,Fit nicely on our wrought iron chairs,,,,,,,,,,,,
2520,"Bought these in late Spring of 2020 and its November 2020 and the cushions are flat. The only good thing about them is the are water proof, so the water doesn't seep through. Just flip and tada, a dry place to sit.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2521,This clamp is very powerful and handy to use either as a clamp or spreader. It does not slip and is very powerful. It is reasonably priced.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2522,So far it works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2523,This toilet was recommended by contractor and it is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2524,Product is very affordable to use and work very well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2525,I use them in book repair and for that they are excellent! Strong enough to keep the book rigid while the glue sets but not enough to damage the covers. Plus the multiple sizes means I can use the proper tool for the job.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2526,"These cushions are awesome, they don't hold the water when it rains they are dry in no time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2527,"These are large strong clamps. They are easy to open but have a very strong hold. I use them in my camper, in my garage, and for every day uses. I never knew how many uses there were for clamps but this is my go to when I need an extra hand to hold things.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2528,"It is all about the flush and this Esteem VorMax does it effectively, efficiently, and quietly.  The round pedestal is very pleasing to us, it makes it a little less ""commode-ish"".  No complaints = 5 stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2529,Great quality and look,,,,,,,,,,,,
2530,"Have not used yet but seem to be quality and at a great price, Thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,
2531,"Does not cut tubing very squarely, but good enough. Tool barely fits 3/8"" pex tube.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2532,"Easy to install, great quality, saved us anton of money just being able to purchase and replace",,,,,,,,,,,,
2533,Very comfortable but bigger than I expected. It works with the chair I have that has no arm rests.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2534,As expected from Bostitch great product and worked great for my project.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2535,"Using the BILT app and following the step by step directions made the installation of both toilets easy and worry-free.  It took me right at an hour and a half per toilet.  They work as advertised, they're quiet and they refill quickly.  Highly recommend!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2536,Works great easy to set up easy to use what more could you ask for,,,,,,,,,,,,
2537,"ProsMostly metal constructionComfortable gripExcellent SprayConsNone, these are greatI have been known over the years to break 1-2 nozzles a season because I get done and drop the hose on the sidewalk or driveway and the nozzle cracks. These a solid. Metal constructed with plastic accents. The adjustments on both are easy to use. The dial nozzle clicks between settings nicely. The spray pattern on the other is easy to move between jet and spray as well. These will be the last nozzles I buy for a while.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,
2538,Cuts square and clean. Very easy to use,,,,,,,,,,,,
2539,"First time I used it wash of my windows, the spray was fine but there was water leaking out the front as if a seal was broken. Little disappointed with the product.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2540,"Bought two of these reversible cushions for the outside patio. They're perfect: colors (floral and stripe reversible), fit, comfort, and strong ties. Wish they were waterproof, but they are spot cleanable.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2541,"Overall, the cushions are not very firm.  We had to put an additional 2"" of dense foam inside the sleeve to get the support needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2542,"This is a serious PITA to install especially when going threw carpet, padding, old wood floor, flooring and sub floor. Template is garbage and needs to be adjusted. Once it is installed it works perfectly and is very solid in construction.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2543,Purchased to give lift to wicker chairs. Very thick and comfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2544,Cushions just as pictured. Comfortable and well made.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2545,They are sturdy and work well,,,,,,,,,,,,
2546,"Used this to install, so I can plug my camper at my home. Worked great",,,,,,,,,,,,
2547,Easy to install. Worked great v,,,,,,,,,,,,
2548,"If you have a Metabo Brad nailer and your having problems with jams, misfires etc, it's because of the brads your using. These seem to be the only ones that work with the Metabo brad nailer. I tried three other brands and they all didn't work. I finally decided to use these and sure enough they work.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2549,Love this toliet sleek and polished. The height is great and it is good on water usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2550,Worked great got two already,,,,,,,,,,,,
2551,Easy to put on but the quality of the screen is very thin. It will do for now.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2552,"I was really surprised how well this worked. Was looking for a traditional sprinkler, but this was all that was in stock. Works much better than expected and super simple to set up. Really pleased!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2553,"Excellent for narrow rectangle at side of house. Impressed with multiple adjustments available, including water volume adjustment at sprinkler.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2554,Works as advertised. It is easy to use and covers a wider area than other brands.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2555,"The screen was easy to cut, easy to manipulate, and definitely pet resistant.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2556,"I was actually surprised by how hefty it is. It is easy to operate, is calibrated right off the shelf and crimps rather easy. For a part timer, I am sure this will be fine for years. Being rifle builders, I and my son found the GO/NO GO a bit amusing, however we do understand the process.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2557,seems that all the DIY stores were out of 1 inch 18G brads. These fit the bill,,,,,,,,,,,,
2558,"Was doing a project for both indoors and out. Excellent ""nails"" zero jam no bending or misfires. Clean fast and productive in all the wood type being used. Soft pine to hard redwood, even did well in weathered wood (wood patio set) that I will stain later. Impressed with the results of the chair rail I installed zero fire thru.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2559,These make PVC cutting easy. Low fuss tool and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2560,I cut out one ceiling can light on our patio for a ceiling fan.  This box conversion could not have been easier.  It is made strong and adjusts to the rafter width easily.A couple of connections and the fan was up.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2561,Easy to work with and install.  We use this for hail protection for our raised beds.  They are rolled out over 6 foot high posts.,,,,,,,,,,,,

2566,Works very well. Easy to setup for full coverage or half.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2567,Working great. Easy on/off for weaker thumbs. Nozzle pattern from fine to wash AC filter to pencil to clean bird poop off the deck.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2568,From the price I paid through the installation and usage of the system I have been very happy. The magnetic mounting system was a breeze and the app is pretty intuitive. I would buy another one anytime.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2569,"The batting inside this cushion is a joke! My bed pillow has more batting inside it. Although the outside fabric looks great, when you sit on the cushion, your behind goes straight down onto the chair slats. One cushion's batting was totally bunched up inside, so you sat at a right-angle. I tried to smooth the batting out a bit, to no avail.  VERY poor interior materials.  Sadly, all of these are being returned.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2570,This works great. Easy installation. It holds a ceiling fan great!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2571,"I bought this because it was made in USA assembled by Vets!  Thinking it would outlast the cheap disposable ones.  Wrong!  The following year I noticed a small stream, about the thickness of a hair.  I was overpriced and no better than the trow away ones I would buy every year.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2572,"We have used these on many projects, from chair rails to ceiling boards & walls. We use them in our craftsman nailer. They are easy to use, load & holds good in areas we use them.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2573,Box is extremely easy to install.  Recessed below cover allowing the cover to be cover to be closed after an item is plugged in.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2574,Updated our master bathroom flooring and decided to upgrade our toilet to 'chair height'.  Works great and has a little smaller tank that fits in our cramped toilet area.  Good product.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2575,"Nice bright colors,  good fit, just the replacements we needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2576,Works like a charm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2577,Does a great job for a cheap little sprinklerSee more,,,,,,,,,,,,
2578,Seems to work ok,,,,,,,,,,,,
2579,Idk what everyone is seeing. But this garbage product doesn't cover anything! The water stream barely goes 2 feet up.. yes . My hose and water source is fine.. I bought 2 of these for the water coverage advertisement!! I am so disappointed.. I can't return these garbage items fast enough!!! I get better coverage from my 15 year old rusted metal lawn sprinkler... don't buy this product!!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2580,Perhaps a little on the flimsy side once you really get them tightened down. But overall work for holding some 4x4s together while I screw them together.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2581,"Slightly higher height, forceful flush, 20 second refill, elegant look.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2582,"Best investment I've made in a long time ! Re-screened the enclosed back porch two years ago so our (crazy) cats could be out there. They hang off the screens chasing bugs especially at night time. Glad to say that there are no holes or snags in this screening so far. Very happy ! The only down side is that this heavy screen does cut down on the air flow just a little bit,but I won't be replacing this screen any time soon !",,,,,,,,,,,,
2583,Works perfectly!!!  A SQUARE!!!  A perfect square,,,,,,,,,,,,
2584,These nails fit my brad gun and feed as needed without jamming.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2585,"It feels a little cheaply made, and the instructions are not real clear, but seems to work okay.  Only time will tell if it lasts.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2586,"Easy to carry and use on the go, vs get off ladder and grab, awesome 3rd hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2587,Large screen porch primarily for my pets. Screen is tough and nice looking. Cat claws have no effect on the screen when they try to grab a bug! Just be sure to adhere securely to top of window so the animals weight does not pull the screen out at the top. Good product I recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2588,These work great. The 18 gauge dewalts shoot good in our bostitch guns also. I like to use the bostitch brand but nice to have a backup.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2589,These cushions were not worth the price. Not very thick!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2590,"Does what it is supposed to do. Works great for watering flowers, especially those in containers. Easily control the amount of water coming out and so many spray options. Feels very sturdy. If I don't beat it, I believe it will last for a long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2591,Good value for the money. Look very nice,,,,,,,,,,,,
2592,I'm short so the chair height is perfect. I just had a Knee Replacement Surgery and needed a taller toilet. This one is perfect!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2593,Works as expected. Easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,

2595,Easy to cut good material.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2596,"When going to the effort of replacing screening, you are kidding yourself if not using something more heavy duty than what you are taking off. I replaced a screen door with this 3 years ago, and it still looks like new. Nuff said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2597,What can I say? They're nails and they worked fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2598,It works.  The fan hasn't fallen down.  Yet.......,,,,,,,,,,,,
2599,"i've purchased an Irwin clamp from Lowes and this clamp from HF. both are of same quality, holds wood tight when i'm cutting it. i do not see any difference in quality but HF's product is $7 cheaper. great value! I will most likely purchase a longer clamp when needed from harbor freight, no doubt about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2600,The Aqua Joe sprinkler gives outstanding coverage on my lawn. I highly recommend it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2601,"We bought these to replace original Hampton Bay cushions on wicker love seats.  Not good!  there is no actual foam in them.  It is actually batting.  I ended up taking the foam out of my old cushions and put those in the new slip covers.  So not worth $60 per set!  Home Depot, you need to do better.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2602,Beautiful cushions at a reasonable price-perfect for my high back chairs!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2603,This cushion is sturdy and comfortable. Fits my bench perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2604,"These cameras are OUTSTANDING! I am Very Happy with them! Excellent Wide View picture! The microphone picks up EVERY Sound, so you can HEAR Perpetrators talking Before , During, and After the crime! The Nest Aware, which is the Cloud Recording, records 24/7/365 which is what makes the cameras So Great!! You Don't Miss NOTHIN!! I HAD Ring, but got rid of it for these Google Cameras!! There is No Comparison! The installation is a little more trickier, cosmetic wise, but once its done, that's it!! ...",,,,,,,,,,,,
2605,I was not sure if these clamps would be upto the job i had for them i should not have worried they are excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,
2606,No one miss firesNo problems Fed great in both of my nailers,,,,,,,,,,,,
2607,"Used this on our front gate to keep our little dog from slipping through the bars. Not the intended purpose of this item, I know, but it works great!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2608,This hose nozzle works great with our standard garden hose. It makes watering plants so much easier. I love how easy it is to change the strength of the stream.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2609,GOOD PRICE & FIT FOR   JOB,,,,,,,,,,,,
2610,"1st time I used they brike, could have been my fault since I thought you could open them wide",,,,,,,,,,,,
2611,Easily installed; really clear picture! Love it. Already caught my neighbors big dog using my yard as his personal toiletâ˜¹ï¸ No denial with live video!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2612,Adjust flow is easy. Feels like it is made from quality material,,,,,,,,,,,,
2613,"Perfect ! Cuts perfectly and no tube distortion .I had lost my generic on a project and had tried my expensive Milwaukee  PVC powered cutter only squash cutting the 1/2"" PEX-A grrrr.  This hand tool exceeded my expectations - you will be happy you bought the premium tool.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2614,My installation was easy. Electrical was single circuit.Easy to replace existing box and install a  ceiling fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2615,"High quality, reasonably priced, nice color. Perfect!",,,,,,,,,,,,
2616,"These clamps were the crucial step in the successful completion of this sideboard repurpose TV/DVD cabinet.  I had a 1/2""x6"" plywood cut (2) pieces to my measurement, glued the two boards with liquidnails and clamped them together with the clamps and let the glue setup over 48 hrs.  Perfect.  The instructions were easy to follow for this budding DIY.  Plus the price was right.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2617,camera works great as long as your upload speed is more then 2meg.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2618,Love it.. perfect fit!,,,,,,,,,,,,
2619,"Work great, no jamming easy feed",,,,,,,,,,,,
2620,The water hose nozzle sprayer began leaking right after the return date. I never dropped it and the hose is connected properly. Go to Home Depot and buy one there. This is a waste of money.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2621,"This is a quality product. Well built, easy to install, sturdy, the box sits back from face of drywall for easy finishing plus it includes a bling cover to keep rough wires clean,  and it comes if a large diameter screw set for fans and slide over the receiver for smaller light fixtures screws",,,,,,,,,,,,
2622,Definitely worth the price and it took a small effort to change the screens on 15 windows. I did a cost comparison with a professional and one window was the cost of 15. Definitely do it yourself if you can.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2623,"I bought it to water my back yard, it is easy to assemble. My kids love it very much and now every time I turn it on, they go outside to play, save my money to buy the kid's sprinkler.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2624,"After about 10 uses it barely holds anymore. It's a quick fix, but not something to get if you want to use it for any period of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2625,"flushes with minimum water, rest is all good except loud flush.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2626,Very strong piece of hardware. Easy to adjust and install. I really recommended if you need to upgrade your ceiling light feature in order to install a ceiling light and fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2627,Great supot.  Square Wich is better to line up the the round one at the blue store,,,,,,,,,,,,
2628,"No jams, no problems. Good quality nail!",,,,,,,,,,,,
